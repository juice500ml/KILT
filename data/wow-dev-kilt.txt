I know I'd be happy if someone handed me snack food a few times a day! Ha!\nSame! Do you know what the treats are made of?\nI think they're made mostly from bran. Way back in Roman times, dog treats were mentioned to be "dog's bread." It's hard to believe dog treats have been around for so long, isn't it?\nyeah I had no idea they made them way back then\nSpain jumped into the dog treat trend back in 1623. They called treats, pan de perro, which translates also to dog's bread. People have been pampering their pets for ages!\nYeah sometimes I think my dog eats better stuff than I do.

I used to have quite the problem with overeating, as I used to be pretty chubby myself. Have you had that issue?\nFortunately I've been able to avoid that problem. I know it can be a big issue during the holidays, as many people tend to overeat during those times.\nThat's true, since there are so many gigantic meals during that time and people don't care as much.\nIt can also happen during festivals because people have built up so much anticipation to the event, and we even encourage overeating sometimes, for instance Thanksgiving.\nWe certainly do encourage overeating in some cases, but it seems to be very rare and it seems like weight loss stuff is really popular around that time too.\nWell I think the market for weight loss programs goes up during that time because they know people will be feeling bad about overeating probably, there's even 12-step programs for overeaters like Overeaters Anonymous.\nI would bet that you're right about that. People get very self conscious around the holidays because of all the food.\nDefinitely, fortunately there are many beneficial theraputic ways to help stop overeating, like group therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for example.\nGood to hear, there's also a lot of self control involved in losing weight that a lot of people just don't seem to have.

My kitchen is actually red - it's at the end of the visible spectrum of light next to orange and opposite violet.\nIt has the longest wavelength from what I can remember!\nIt does - you are smart!

That they are much better off at home with their parents/guardians

Open mic is where audience members get up and try material. \nOh so just random people I bet they are not as good as the pros
I have a twin in real life and when people see us together, I get real sick of them asking if we are twins!\nHow interesting! A developing fetus is called a singleton if they are alone but a multiple if there is more than one developing!\nThose embryos sure like multiplying! I wonder if twins are more rarer than triplets?\nWell, the twin birth rate in the US rose from 18.9 to 33.3 for every 1,000 births between 1980 and 2009\nWow, do you know what caused the spike in the rate? Is it a genetic thing?

I'm a huge fan of Jazz! It's an awesome music genre with cool African-American roots which is what I love about it!\nJazz is fantastic, although it seems to have fallen from popularity since the 50's, where rock and roll took over.\nYeaha and in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it developed into blues and ragtime too.\nModern Jazz appears to be more inspired by those evolutions than the original Jazz that was prevalent in the 1920's\nYeah it seems like it. I like how all the musical styles it's connected to lead to African-American and European-American. Another awesome thing is it's evolved into performance as well!\nA Personal favorite genre of mine is where jazz instruments were introduced back into Rock and Roll and became Ska.\nThat's nice too! Originally it was characterized by swing and blue notes for example, response vocals and polyrhythms but of course all that evolved with time too.\nIt seems like Jazz is the bedrock for most modern American Music, with Bluegrass making up the rest.

"Why was 6 afraid of 7?'\nYeah I have heard that, funny. Long ago 7 was written in a curve so it looked like a J.\nReally? I didn't know that. Why was it changed from the curved J to the 7 it is today?\nThat is just how they wrote. The western Ghubar Arabs' made it more diagonal than straight to kind of differentiate it.\nI guess that would make sense.

Seen any teenage scene girls lately? They might be willing, lol.

It's the second most common color.\nI don't know if I want to be common though. Should I dye it so it's not brown anymore?\nWell if you want to get away from brown hair, why not try an unnatural color like cadet blue or purple?\nBecause if I dye it cadet blue, I'm worried that means I'll have to join the Air Force.

If physical fitness is the state of well being, i am just the opposite.\nInteresting. That's too bad. Do you know much about fitness?

It doesn't surprise me though, women like change, it's boring to always look the same.\nYes it is, and there is huge money spent on it, like $1.9 billion in 2011\nWow, well sometimes it's worth it to spend money on looks. Even though dyeing hair can damage hair permanently. It's hard to get back to natural color.
Red is such a passionate, vibrant color\nIt really is!

I guess they used it since its easy to make.
I am so happy I haven't ahd to put my children in childcare or daycare and have someone else caring and supervising them.\nYes, I would always be nervous about what happens during the time away from my children.\nI know that is how I felt, you never know what happens when nannies, babysitters, teachers or other providers are taking care of your children\nActual references from close friends would be the only way I would go with a babysitter\nI would definitely be more inclined to go that route when choosing the perfect care giver for my kids.

Funny how fads come and go so quickly.
I've never really thought much about childcare or daycare for children under six and up to 13 weeks. I am still young. Yourself?\nI don't know much about childcare.

Do you think so?\nIt is important and I would be concerned about sending my 13 week old child to the daycare. \nYes that is very true. I have read that Day Care can actually refer to daytime care for disabled or elderly people in the UK. I think this is positive.\nThat would be positive. Are there any requirements if it is for older people.\nNo just no ageism or the stereotyping and discrimination of individuals based on age.\nIs there anyone who regulates it? 
I've had issues with my weight in the past. I'm doing really well and have lost almost 50 pounds so far.\nObesity increases the likelyhood of other conditions.

Meat and vegetable, berries, etc.\nI guess that makes it healthier, do you like the diet, did you try any others?\nI like this one. I have tried vegetarianism because I am Indian, but felt like my body really needed meat!\nLol I like meat too, but I wouldn't mind vegetarianism. You have any dieting tips?

Good evening, have you ever been to a circus and encountered a comic performer such as a clown?\nYes indeed! Gotta say -- I'm not a big fan. There's something a bit creepy about them. How about you?\nI completely agree.  The older that I get, the more afraid of them I become.  One group of clowns that I find frightening is the group Insane Clown Posse.  Have you heard of them? \nAren't they more of a music group? But, yes -- point taken! I know their fans, the Juggalos, dress up in clown-like makeup. I think more of clowns like Steven King's "It"!\nThat's true, they are a music group.  Juggalos are freaky along with the movie IT.  I can't believe that people were dressing up like evil clowns back in 2016 and hiding near schools.  Wouldn't that be freaky to encounter one at night?\nTotally agree. I'm not sure what would motivate people to do the evil clown dress up -- I guess the thrill of spooking people. Not funny! Did you see IT?\nI did see IT.  I think I remember seeing it on TV right when it came out in 1986. That movie still freaks me out to this day.  I haven't seen the new version yet.  Have you?\nNO! And I forgot about the original. Stephen King is a master at what he does. And I did notice that IT is now on HBO. So if you want to rewatch it.....ha!

Nevertheless, thanks to Whey, I gained 6.6 pounds of muscle mass
I enjoy exercise, but I need to do more research about physical fitness.\nIt is a state of well-being, health and the ability to participate of sports, occupations and activities.\nIndeed. I used to run in college, but then I started having trouble with my knees. What else might I try?\nI was a tennis player but that is bad on the knees. Physical fitness is generally thought of as proper nutrition, exercise and an adequate rest period.\nSo it's a combination of those things and not just exercise?\nYes! Before the industrial revolution, people thought of fitness as the ability to get through the day's activities and survive! lol\nI guess so. Life was harder back then, especially if you spent all day working in the fields.

Everyday i buy my dog some dog biscuits, he loves them!\nHow do dogs eat those things?  they are so dry and hard!  What possible benefit could they get from them, other than taste, which apparently they do like.\nWell some of them have vitamins, and they nibble on them slowly, the taste is sometimes so great that i try one :D do you have a dog?\nYes, I have a dingo, which is a type of feral dog from Australia.  Have you heard of them?  \nYes they seem nice, i have a Pekingese, but he is black not so ugly as the brown ones, he haves white paws\nOh, i see.  great dog, but probably poos everywhere. don't they cross them with other breeds to make peekapoos or peke-a-tese?\nYes they do, but i dont like Pekingese, or peekapoos, i got it from a shelter so i was ok with him :D now my mother takes care of it :D\nprobably a good choice for your mother, since they are docile companion animals.  That's why they call them Lap-dogs.\nExactly im too young for that kind of a dog, but i sure like them dog biscuits :D

What caused the revitalization?

Between the costume, airfare, hotel, and meals, it seems like quite an expensive hobby.\nYes it is pretty expensive, and its a four-day event (Thursday–Sunday) held during the summer, so staying there also makes it more expensive \nI'm sure that San Diego is beautiful and they have a wonderful time.  If they get bored, they could always visit the San Diego Zoo!!!!!

How did that evolve into someone who cleans a house?\nI'm not sure. I was hoping you knew. In Victorian times the maids were expected to remain unmarried.\nWhy did they need to remain unmarried?\nBecause they needed to devote all their time to the household.

In 1975, only a generation ago, more than half of all children had a stay-at-home parent\nYes, I agree. Now they're are a lot of stay-at-home dads.

Obesity is the number one problem now days. It's going to kill more people then cancer.
Have you ever heard of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?\nYes, it is interesting that the diagnosis is based on symptoms for the most part.\nThere has been very little research until recently and it was often misdiagnosed as Fibromyalgia.

The sun makes it look almost blonde at times.\nMe too! My brown hair used to be blonde when I was younger.\nThat seems to happen a lot. I wonder what causes hair to change color like that.
My mother is a twin and I think it's pretty cool, having siblings that are produced at the same time !\nAwesome. That's rare!\nYes, she's a fraternal twin, so they developed from two different eggs. But, still pretty cool.\nDo twins run in the family?

Do you know if he makes his own clothes and shoes? I think he might.
I've been looking into different hair colorings to mask my grey, but I'm worried about if they're dangerous. Help!\nI dont think its dangerous, hair dyeing with enough practice is good if done on other people to change their hair color.rather than yours. \nMight be a little hard to get volunteers for me practicing hair coloring. Seen any teenage scene girls lately? They might be willing, lol.\nWell you can always have it done by a professionally hairdresser or at home by someone else who has done it before. \nProfessional hairdresser might be the best idea. Should I go with a conventional hair color, or something wild and fun?\nSomething fun sounds great, you want to look your best for the guys. just use one bottle and dont over do it or you will ruin the color! \nUse three bottles to make sure it sticks, got it. I could always bleach it, right? That could be exciting!
A lot of people see clowns as physically comedic, but I've always found them physically intimidating.\nSame here i actually find them to be very scary in my opinion \nI think since a lot of cultures have their own styles and variations in costumes when it comes to clowns, some may be creepier than others.\nYeah thats very true.  Is there anything else you can tell me about clowns?\nThe way they entertain is usually from a distance by design, which is especially suited for large audiences.  The farther away the better.\nThanks for the information i had no idea.  Maybe one day i will go see a clown show and face my fears.

Is it healthier (calories/carbs/etc) than normal pasta? \nNo, I believe they are similar in that regard. I just have to avoid the gluten found in grains like wheat.\nOh ok, that makes sense. Well there is always the vegetable option. For example, Noodles & Company now offers a Zucchini noodle option for their entries. It's fantastic!
I consider myself to be rather high-brow since I enjoy tasting expensive wines.\nI like tasting wine too, but it doesn't have to be expensive.

They are professional wine tasters. \nPerhaps I should. I usually avoid labelling myself but in this case it might be appropriate! \nSommeliers usually work in fine restaurants and specialize in all aspects of wine and how wines match with foods. \nWell it might be time to look for a new job then. Sommeliers get to taste wine and food! 
One of my favorite stores to go to is Target. Mainly because they seem to have the best mix of quality and price.\nMe too! Target was founded in Minnesota which is where I'm from.

Mark Dayton (of the same family) is now our governer!\nDamn that's longer than I expected! How did he go from founding Target to being the governor? \nHe didn't personally found it, but his family are Minnesota business tycoons and he is now one of the wealthiest people in out state. His family's wealth helped his political career.\nAhh okay that makes more sense. Must be a pretty powerful family with being that rich and holding positions in state government!\nYes they certainly are powerful! However he actually has a pretty good approval rating as far as I know, he also has helped our state budget stay in surplus though his policies. \nThat's impressive, good thing he isn't just in that position because his family is powerful.
My favorite color is red.\nmy favorite color is pink! what can you tellme about red
Isn't it crazy that fitness used to refer to your ability to not get tired while doing normal activities?\nWow! I had no idea.

My youngest daughter has had pink hair.\nThat's pretty awesome. More people are doing it. In the US, at home coloring reached $1.9 billion in 2011. That's a lot of dye. \nI agree! That is a whole lot of dye! lol So how do you like your purple hair?\nI like it a lot! The color is great. In the US and Europe, purple is associated with royalty and magic. Sorta cool. \nDo you like in Europe or the United States? Purple is my favorite color. My friends actually call me PIRPS for short. lol

I think that chestnut brown is a beautiful color of hair, but most women tend to dye their hair when it's brown. Do you think natural brown hair is pretty?\nI think its beautiful, they dye it i think because its the second most common hair color\nWould you consider dying your hair a crazy color for a month if you knew you could get it back to its original color at the end of the month?\nThen yes :D , but i would do it at home, not at the hairdressers i would be ashamed :D\nWhat color would you choose and why? Would you hide the color from others when going out for that month, or would you embrace the change and see what happened\nWell i would probably not make it for a month and hide all the time, and after few days give a tip to my hairdresser to come and fix the change :D\nHahaha. I think I would love to have a neon color head of hair, but I think I would have to have an excuse for dying it. My friends and family would think I had gone crazy if I just did it for no reason, but I actually think it would be quite fun to do.\nhehe the reason why for me i would say that i did it because i want to be like Lucifer from Supernatural drama, if you have seen it\nI have not seen that show, other than the commercials for it. What color is his hair in that show?

I thought it was the other way around. \nDid you know in the early years Enzo Ferrari actually wanted to produce road cars and not sports cars.\nI am surprised to hear that. tHe fact that he was a racing driver would make me believe he wanted sports cars. \nOver the years Team Ferrari has won 15 World Drivers Championship titles 
Good evening, have you ever been to a circus and encountered a comic performer such as a clown?\nYes indeed! Gotta say -- I'm not a big fan. There's something a bit creepy about them.

Have you heard of them? \nAren't they more of a music group? But, yes -- point taken! I know their fans, the Juggalos, dress up in clown-like makeup. I think more of clowns like Steven King's "It"!\nThat's true, they are a music group.  Juggalos are freaky along with the movie IT.  I can't believe that people were dressing up like evil clowns back in 2016 and hiding near schools.  Wouldn't that be freaky to encounter one at night?\nTotally agree. I'm not sure what would motivate people to do the evil clown dress up -- I guess the thrill of spooking people. Not funny! Did you see IT?
Snoop Dogg is so awesome, he's a great rapper and does a lot for his community as well\nHe is awesome!

How do you make bread?\nWell you just need some dough, water, and yeast and then you can bake it in the oven, quite simple.\nYou don't need anything else? What if I add pepperoni to it? Do I put in from the start or later on in the cooking process?\nI wouldn't suggest adding a cure porked and beef mixed-together product in my bread, but I guess you could try, I'd add it in from the start I suppose.\nWell Italian culture we cook pepperoni and mozz bread you should try it, it's good!  I just don't know how! lol

Each egg has its own sperm cell\nIt's very interesting how twins seem to run in certain families - is it hereditary?\nIt seems to be - the yoruba people have the highest rate of twins in the world - 90 to 100 twins per 1000 live births\nWow - that is amazing - perhaps it also gives them a way to re-populate faster if there is some other kind of environmental reason

the number 7 is a great number.\nAbsolutely, it follows 6 and precedes 8!

I have never watched that movie, but I will research on it in a little. Any other superhero movies?
Target always felt like the slightly classier walmart.\nThey have certainly always seemed to have a better reputation, considering all the protest from small-town advocates, labor unions, and the like.\nI like the feel of target but there isnt much special about it i feel.\nIn my personal experience, they seem to keep cleaner stores, but have less variety overall and slightly higher prices.\nexactly, thats a perfect description, not much to look at but a nice store and high prices.\nIt would be nice for there to be some kind of cross between Target and Walmart. Lower prices, and cleaner store with variety - and a company that cared about its employees. But I doubt that will happen.\nYea but its all about making money sadly.

Id be willing to try one, if the company would be willing to donate me one. Im sure they can afford it\nHah, if your company is willing to pay for an electric car, you should definitely go for it. Would probably save you a ton of money in the long run. Better for the environment too because of the batteries and solar panels.\nI would definatly love to try it.

I haven't been scuba diving. Do you wear a dry suit that normally protects the body?\nI used to dive in Turkey, Egypt so 5mm wet suit or 7mm half dry were enough. But in cold waters you definitely need a dry suit. I have completed my training but couldn't dive with a dry suit yet. It is so hard to dive with dry suit for me. Last time I tried it I went upside down in the water.  \nInteresting! So the difference between dry suits and wetsuits is that dry suits prevent water from entering?\nYes dry suits do not get any water where wet suits get a bit of water inside but it does not let it go out so keeps you still a bit warmer as it prevents water moving

I guess maybe in Asia.\nActually brown hair is common in the Western world such as Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Southern Cone, the United States, and also some populations in the Greater Middle East where it transitions smoothly into black hair.\nInteresting. I guess I don't see too much black hair where I live.

I was speaking to a friend earlier about James Brown and how he influenced so many genres of music starting in the 60's.\nThe "Godfather of Soul". James Brown. \nBorn in the early 1930's.

I've done some programming in C++ in the past, but am now trying to learn Python. \nI know a bit about C++ but what is Python? Is it similar?\nWell Python is object oriented in the same way that C++ is. But my impression of Python is that it is easier to use, but less efficient (in use of computer resources) to run.\nI see. My brother is a 3D programmer and uses C++ for his work. So, Python is not as versatile? I remember when I first learned how to write and use a function.\nPython is actually very versitile as a high level language. I'd call it more "powerful" than C++, but it may not be a good choice when computing resources are at a premium.\nRight. I was only about 8 years old when the first "PC's" were released like the Tandy Color Computer and the TRS-80 hehe.

It's known for its dominant vocals, strong use of harmony and Christian lyrics. It's really beautiful music.\nThat does sound powerful just reading about it, does it have a long history?\nIt does, but it's not well documented. The earliest use of the term "gospel song" was first published in 1874.\nOh I would imagine it's probably older than that given the history of churches I guess. Are there any famous gospel artists I should know about?\nWell actually, before it was known as gospel music, that typical style of music can be traced back to the early 17th century.\nOh cool, did it have a different name back then?

I think I might need more exercise.
I don't understand why people with gray hair try to cover it up with coloring\nI agree, there is nothing wrong with gray or speckled hair. Perhaps it is because many celebrities do it as well.\nEven more odd is the granny hair trend where young women are coloring their hair different shades of gray.\nPerhaps if more young women did that then the older women would stop dying their hair! Funny how fads come and go so quickly.\nYes.  They say the trend is attributed to fasion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier's  2011 fashion show\nThe strangest hair trend to me is the mullet. I have seen quite a few men sporting them recently.
Here's a thought I just had while showering: the original showers were actually waterfalls!\nOh why do you you think that?\nIt's just historical fact! But there's evidence that early (rich) Egyptians had indoor shower rooms.\nI see so do they also have indoor toilet?\nIt's possible, because they did have rudimentary drainage systems in the rooms.\nSo they would be using copper for it then?

I have super super dark brown hair most people think my hair is black\ndoes your family also have dark hair - true black hair is a dominant genetic trait among people of all backgrounds and ethnicities\nI know my mom is a red head, I never met my dad but my mom said his hair color was the same, and he was very light complected like myself and my mom\nThat's interesting because a darker person usually have more individual hair follicles on their scalp so they are darker.  Are you siblings the same?\nI have 1 brother blonde and blue eyed\nIs the blond yellowish color?  Very different than brown/almost black hair!  The 2 types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin make up hair color. \nno it is very very blond, not a yellow color at all\nI wonder if skin color has anything to do with it - skin pigmentation is also genetic from their birth parents. \nWe are both very light complected, as well as both my parents, not sure where the dark hair came from as far as my dad goes, somewhere back in the genes I guess

I think we need to go back to teaching basic cooking skills in school, like they do in Britain. \nYes, but in France, childhood obesity is growing faster than obesity in adults\nOh dear, I didn't know that.

I think a lot of people want to blame obesity on the person, but I think some cases can be blamed on genes.

People don't think enough about early child care.  Quaility care at a young age can have a big impact on the child's future success.\nI agree my kids have been in daycare from 2 months and up and once my oldest got age 2 I changed her to a private christian academy education is so important. \nTypically children are taken care of by parents or siblings, but daycare is very popular in the U.S.\nIt became popular because of the fact parents have to go to work the rates are sky high as well. \nOh yeah, day care is basically the term that describes that.  it's a service usually during specific hours for while the parents are at work.\nYou have a few that services 24 hour but rarely, I think tat's what come into play also in child care as you mentioned earlier where parents lack but some can't afford that fee or it doesn't fit their schedule.

I have a friend who is suffering from obesity, do you know what that is? 
Red the color at the end of the visible light spectrum looks good on everyone. Don't you think?\nI am more of a fan of green.  That would leave us only one primary color: Blue.\nBut the dominant wavelength of red is approximately 625–740. That's impressive!\nHey, i have seen many a red sunset, and the wavelength you have mentioned is the reason.\nI'm sure those sunsets were brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion.

I have a friend who is struggling maintaining her sobriety. She says it's tough to achieve a life balance.\nStruggling with addiction is so hard you're a good person for listening to her. Is it drugs or alcohol?\nThank you. It's alcohol. She spent some time in a treatment setting to get started on the path to sobriety, but now that she's out, she's having a tough time.\nLet her know you'll be there for her during thoughts of relapse. Is she attending AA classes? I know those help a lot.\nShe isn't, but I'll definitely pass on the suggestion! She said the first physical effects of withdrawal were tough, but the second stage, PAWS, might be worse!\nCan you tell me what PAWS means? Hopefully she has an AA sponsor!\nPAWS stands for post acute withdrawal syndrome. During this stage recovering addicts usually experience emotional and psychological symptoms.

My favorite color is red. I think it looks great by itself or contrasted with blue. Do you like red?\nI love red from the bluish-red of crimson to the yellow tinged scarlet, it is probably the most prominent color.\nYes, there are so many shades of red. I think my favorite one is firehouse red, which is very bright and luminous. Red is also a primary color.\nYea its been a big part across many cultures due to it being the color of blood, it was used in Mayans and Egyptians ceremonies, as well as by the Romans.\nThat is a great point.

My favourite is scarlet.\nScarlet is a beautiful shade of red! Crimson is another if I'm not wrong?\nYes, there are lots of different shades of red. Interestingly, a shade is red mixed with black, and a tint is red mixed with white - so pink could be a tint of red.\nWow, that's crazy.

When was rock music the most popular?\nPerhaps in the 1950s and mid 1960s, as this was the time when the "more encompassing international style" of rock music came about\nIs rock and roll still popular today?  \nIt's hard to say. However, radio stations have much success playing classic rock and roll, which is a sub genre that usually has one or two electric guitars, a double bass or string bass or electric bass guitar, and a drum kit.\nI used to listen to the rock band Rolling Stones.  Are they still around today?\nThey are! Even though they were formed in 1962 and have had a long list of line-up changes, they're still around today, with Mick Jagger still leading the band.\nWow, that is a long time to be playing music.  I wonder if any other bands have been around that long.

I have very long hair and would be so upset if I had to cut it off.
I'm not a twin, but I think it's interesting how two offspring canbe produced at the same time. \nOh yeah. I have known a lot of twins in my life and I find it a pretty cool phenomenon. \nFor fraternal twins each twin is fertalized by its own sperm cell. \nAre those the type of twins that don't look alike?\nYup, that's because they have two different combinations of DNA\nThe Olsen twins are fraternal but they look identical. I find that funny. But it makes sense because a lot of different aged siblings look just alike too.

I have to admit I have a problem with caffeine myself. I love coffee hot in the morning, then I switch to iced coffee later in the day.  \nI do the same thing! I love some whipped cream on my coffee in the morning.
Science Fiction often predicts future inventions, t is an act of creative imagination.\nYes, you said that right, a lot of Star Wars, or Star trek inventions became a reality \nThe difference to fantasy is that it avoids the supernational and often has a foundation in actual science.

I prefer the professional touch of home bakers, since now most baking is automated by machines in factories.\nYes you can taste the diference in the baking hoven, pizzerias for example bake in wooden hovens and tastes so unique!
I love to exercise. I feel so sluggish on days when I don't work out at the gym.\nMe too! Exercise helps me with a state of health and well-being. It allows me to perform aspects of sports, work, and daily activities.\nWhat kind of sports do you like to play?
Once I swam with a Manta ray. \nThat's incredible, was it a reef manta ray? They're the biggest species out of all of them\nI really don't know they were pretty large, do you know anything else?\nThey were first given the name in 1868 by an Australian Museum director, they are relatively docile too.\nDid  you know that The greatest threat to manta rays is over fishing?

I've never really thought much about childcare or daycare for children under six and up to 13 weeks. I am still young. Yourself?\nI don't know much about childcare. Is it rated somehow so you know you are getting a good one?\nI think it is because the action of skill of looking after children as a provider is very important. Do you think so?\nIt is important and I would be concerned about sending my 13 week old child to the daycare. \nYes that is very true.

I have been sober for four months now and feel great.\nCongratulations! Achieving your goal of not consuming alcohol is not easy, but you did it!\nI just stopped drinking wine.  It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.  Still miss it with nice dinners though.\nMedical personnel point out that the long term effects of drinking alcohol include damage to the liver and brain, so I'd say you're better off without it!\nSo true.  Liver damage is no joke.  Wouldn't want those symptoms.\nAbsolutely not. Sobriety means you don't have any measurable effects from alcohol, so being sober means you're healthier.\nI wonder how long it takes to clear out the bad effects of alcohol?
I'm thinking of dyeing my hair! I want to try a different hair color.\nYou should! What color did were you thinking?\nI'm not sure! Maybe a medium brown shade. I need to cover my grey hair! \nI like brown hair. It is so pretty!\nThanks! We'll see I guess!

Less room for error.

I love going to the bakery and seeing the baker cook stuff. Do you know any cool stuff about bakers? \nGrains have been a staple food for millennia, baking is a very old one! \nThats neat, I bet that baking has a very long heritage, Did people in the stone age know how to bake food? \nI don't think they did, but by the 5th and 6th centuries the ancient Greeks were using ovens. Most communities had one large shared oven.\nwow the greeks had ovens? thats really cool. What kind of ovens did they use? Was it coal or fire? \nThese enclosed ovens were heated by wood fires that were mainly for different types of bread.\nOh alright, That makes sense, since wood is easily available and I dont think greeks knew what coals were back then. What else do you know about bakers? \nIn ancient Rome a few centuries later the first mass production of bread started. They say being a professional baker started then.\nI had a feeling bakers started in Europe. Since there is a lot of cuisines from Europe that are baked. 
Not too long ago, I was severely overweight. Considered obese for my height. It's been a struggle but I have lost some of it.\nWhat was your Body Mass Index? Was it high?\nYes. It was a 35. I have it down to a 32 now.
My favorite color is red, it's flashy, catches people's attention, and is used everywhere for all kinds of purposes!\nMine too! Its said that red makes a person appear more attractive, like an illusion of sorts!\nOh yeah, I'm not surprised. Red and other colors are super influential. Cops are more likely to pull over a car if it's red.\nOh no! I need a new car now. Lol
My dog loves dog biscuits I think he is obsessed with them\nSame my dogs just loves them. but they tend to be hard and dry\nOh no there are some that are soft and chewy, made my milk bone\nYeah i have heard some may be sold in a flat bone-shape as well\nI have seen those as well. They even have some softy ones made from duck
I find Ferrari's interesting but don't know much about them\nIts only of the most iconic Italian sports car company in the world and makes all their cars in Maranello, Italy.\nSo there's no other manufacturing warehouse for Ferrari anywhere in the world?
Hey Im Jim and I am a baker who works at a local bakery. I am pretty smart and know the way of the dough, What would you like to know? \nHi Jim, I am thinking of opening my own bakery since I enjoy baking. Do you think I should sell baked cookies or pizza?\nI think cookies are a good choice, Just go with the basic ingredients like flour, sugar and some kinda oil. \nI see, do I need to marinate the cookies in oil before I serve them?\nThats not necessary, You only use the oil to mix with the dough, it makes the cookie less dry and gives it a nice smooth taste. Also use it to prevent the cookies from sticking to the pan. \nThanks for the tip, I have big trouble with dough that sticks to the pan and doesn't come off! Should I serve sushi along with cookies?\nI never really thought of it, but that does sounds good just as long as you have Sushi with the basics like brown or white rice. Dont add any sauces or it might clash with the taste of the cookies. \nI am just worried that serving sushi without Wasabi sauce might make my customers angry. Do you think a bit of Wasabi sauce is okay?
Do you like Pasta? I used to eat it every day about as a kid, so now I am a bit tired of it\nI love pasta! I could eat it almost everyday! Personally I like fresh pasta, but dried is fine too!\nOh trust me, you do not want to do that, it gets old very quickly, I would know

I love coloring my hair! It's fun to play with all the different shades of dye. Have you ever colored your hair?\nYes, I have made it purple and red before.\nThose are fun colors! Did you have it done professionally or did you dye it at home?\nThe red I did at home. The purple I had to have done professionally to get it to stick.\nThat makes sense! Home coloring is a huge business! In 2011, sales reached $1.9 billion and they're thought to have reached $2.2 billion in 2016.\nI can see that from all of the commercials that are on TV. Do you notice that they always show basic colors like black or brown?\nThat's a good point! They do always show black or brown! Believe it or not, 75% of all women claim to have dyed their hair at least once. Surely they used some other colors!\nI would think so! Although, I guess covering gray and making it look natural is responsible for most of those billions.
Hi, I'm looking to buy a Harley bike. Have you any suggestions?\nAny Harley is a good choice with their style of customization.\nNice, I want one that is really loud. \nWell, their customization can do that for you but you may have trouble with your local laws!\nTrue, I don't want to get into trouble. Which Harley is your favorite?\nI don't have a favorite.  I consider Harley-Davidson and all motorcyles them death wish machines/donor mobiles!\nOh, so you don't like them, but are still an expert? That is cool. 
I really like to listen the gospel music, how about you?
Red is next to orange and opposite of violet in the spectrum of light! \nOh really? I never knew that! Red is one of my favorite colors!

They range from scarlet and vermillion to crimson to pale red pink to dark red burgandy. \nI love dark red burgandy! It's a very rich color. Do you agree?
Have you heard of Yamaha? They started as a piano manufacturer in 1887!\nI have heard of it. The make a lot of different things now right?\nYes, after WW2 the president repurposed their wartime production machine to make motorcycles\nI know they make four wheelers and jetskis too.
One of my favorite foods is pasta.  300 different forms, easy to make and hard to master.  What about you?\nI love pasta, too. My favorite is lasagna.\nLasagna was actually invented some time in the Middle Ages, most likely in Naples!  I love it as well!\nOh wow, I didn't realize it had been around that long. I prefer it without meat. My mom makes a great veggie lasagna.\nA friend of mine gets pasta made from rice flour because she does not like gluten.  It apparently tastes a little different.\nI've never tried rice flour. I imagine it would taste a bit different, though. I've tried coconut flour, but it probably wouldn't taste good in pasta.
I try to give my dog a dog biscuit every couple of days, they're a hard biscuit-based dietary supplement, similar to human snack food.\nI give mine a dog biscuit every day when he goes to sleep.  Do you think they are healthy?\nI'm kind of torn, I think probably they aren't, but the hard and dry texture probably helps clean their teeth, at least according to some manufacturers.\nI want to believe that, anyway I don't think one every day can cause much daamage, specially for a big dog like mine.  \nYeah that's probably true, it's crazy to think that dog biscuits have been around since the Roman times, where they were called "Dog's bread."\nInteresting,  I guess people have wanted to spoil their dogs since the beginning of human-dog relationship..
I love baking pies and cheesecake in my spare time but I would love to expand into other things could you tell me more about being a baker?\nI have always been interested in the role of a baker and bakery  their work and it's historical significance.\nWhat do you find the most interesting about the historical significance of bakers?
I like the number 7, which comes between 6 and 8.\nWhats so special about it?\nNothing really. The Hindus used to write their 7's like an uppercase J, vertically inverted.\nThe only time I like the number seven is when i'm shooting dice.
My favorite color is red do you like it?\nI like red, but pink is my favorite it is named after a flowering plant in the genus Dianthus. \nWhat is the wavelength of red\nI'm not sure about the specific wavelength of red. The Greek letter lambda is used as a symbol for wavelength. \nWhat else do you know about it\nwavelength repeats and has the inverse of the spatial frequency. \nO wow I did not know that
Have you ever heard of Chronic fatigue syndrome?\nI have! My aunt suffered with it for many years. She was diagnosed based on her symptoms, I don't think a clear diagnostic test exists. Have you known anyone who's had it?\nI have not, it sounds like something that would be awful, what are some of the characteristics of it?\nIt's fatigue that is not due to strenuous exertion and rest doesn't really provide much relief. It's not due to a previous medical condition, so its cause remains somewhat of a mystery.\nOh no, that is awful, so I assume they have no cure for it then\nNo, unfortunately not. There is no cure and no medications or procedures to treat CFS have been approved in the US. \nDarn, is it pretty common in the United States
I love Jazz music me and my friends go to a local Jazz club twice a month.
Hello, are you into a physical fitness routine? \nI do not currently have one no.\nI don't have a strict one either but I try to eat the right foods and exercise some.\nThe right foods are often time very expensive, and i'm not the best off with money.\nIt sure is. So I take it you don't shop at places like Whole Foods?\nI do not think we have one of those at my current location. I live in an underdeveloped location of the world.
Hi, I work as a clown at a local circus.\nThat sounds like a fun job! Do you perform slapstick type physical comedy or mime style?\nYea it is! I mostly do slapstick type because the kids like it more.\nI can see that! Clowns are very good at entertaining large audiences, even at a distance! \nI agree, I usually gather about 300 people for my shows. When they leave, they cry because they wasted their money!\nOh, I doubt that!!  Do you wear the typical "red clown" type of costume with a colorful wig and clothing, exaggerated footwear and distinctive makeup?\nMostly a red clown, with a red nose and colorful hair. Sometimes, kids get scared of me!

Hi!  Do you know anything about manta rays?\nI know they are found in warm temperature such as subtropical and tropical water!\nThey are pretty amazing creatures.  You can swim with them as they are quite docile.\nYes they are so large too! And belong to the genus Manta.\nWow!  do you know any other cool facts about them?  I didn't know their genus!\nSo they are similar to whales as in they breach, but no one really knows why!\nThat is crazy.  I would never have thought they would be grouped with whales.  How big do they get?

I like jazz music. It is a genre that originated from New Orleans by the African Americans\nOh, Mee too like jazz music. can you share more about that\nMany people see Jazz music as classic music. \nIts a traditional music\nIt started in the form of independent traditional and popular music styles\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to many distinctive styles.
i love me some pasta\nit is very good! Pasta  is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine\nwhen was it created\nif i recall first reference dating to 1154 in Sicily\nwhat can you make with it
I am a computer programmer. I do not have a degree in it, though.\nI'm studying to be a programmer and computer engineer myself.\nThat's awesome. I have two degrees in environmental engineering, but I love programming!\nOh cool! I want to get better at programming and software engineering since I'm not great yet.\nYou will get there! It takes years to master a subject and a craft.\nAre you more of an engineer in your career than a computer programmer?\nMy job requires a bit of both. I have to use programmable logic controllers and software integrated with engineered devices.
Clowns have a long tradition of using lots of variety in their costumes\nI'm not sure how I really feel about clowns. I never thought about it much until the media started making them scary.\nI saw "It" and I'm pretty sure how I feel about clowns.\nI saw that plus the remake and the remake makes clowns a lot more scarier. I'm surprised they still have them in the circus.\nI haven't seen the remake yet. Not brave enough.  The clown from Poltergeist was pretty evil, too.\nClowns were so innocent I'm not sure when they started getting a bad rap.\nWhat was the name of the evil clown from American Horror Story?

I know many people think of pasta as Italian, but I love it here in America!\nThere is indefinitely a difference between what American's consider pasta and what Italians consider pasta.\nOh, I don't doubt that. I know dried pasta is very convenient, but many think fresh pasta is better tasting.\nI prefer fresh. But making fresh pasta is a huge time commitment.\nYes, it is. I know there are many machine-made pasta, but not quite the same as hand-made.\nI was raised on fresh pasta but never from a machine. It's more time consuming to prep, clean and store.

All the the shades from red crimson to red burgundy are so pretty!\nI think pink is a really cool color, but regular red just doesn't do it for me.

A lot of the earth's surface is also inundated with iron oxide, and other iron compounds, such as iron sulfate (pyrite).\nI just don't see how you hate red. It has a lot of important history.

Did you have it done  professionally by a hairdresser or did you do it yourself at home?\nI did it at home and obviously did not think it through, Burgandy is not a natural hair color so it looks weird\nInterestingly, in 2016 sales for home coloring kits were close to $2.2 billion!

I would feel even better using an extended family member of my child\nAbsolutely.  It would be perfect to have a family member involved.  The extra pure love is key!\nVery true, that is why I think it is best when parents or or legal guardians take care of their children, because they are they only ones that love the children\nIt is difficult for some who do not have the financial resources to stay home though.  Tough situation.

Early child care is equally important and often overlooked in child development.\nYes, it's definitely better to have young children in a place that will aid in their social and intellectual development.\nThat's so true. And daycare is typically an ongoing service during specific time periods like when you need to work.\nI wish there were more commercial daycares open for those that have to work third shift. Unfortunately, those are few and far between.
I'm sick of my purple hair, but I'm not sure if changing it would be too damaging to my hair
I love shopping at Target, its so much better than Walmart even if its a little more expensive.\nYes, i agree. I love Target also.

Hello, so what are your thoughts on pasta?\nI love pasta, it is such a versatile food! I really enjoy Italian food for its great flavors, and of course, it involves lots of pasta!\nTrue, me too.  We have an Italian shop around the corner and I see them making fresh pasta.  Delicious!\nOh wow I have never seen that before! How do they make fresh pasta?\nIt's working the pasta dough and flattening or elongating it with a pasta machine attached to a bench.  What pastas do you usually get>?

I don't have much interest in comic books or anything, but found it interesting. \nDid you participate in cosplay? What is your character of choice?\nActually, no I did not dress in cosplay. But if I did, I probably would have went as an Overwatch character! Maybe McCree?
I like target but they are a little pricey 
Baking is such a fun passtime, plus you get baked goods when they're done.\nBaking is a lot of fun, I really like making bread, it's lots of work but well worth it!\nBread is one of my favorite things to bake too!\nI wish I could call myself a baker, that would be an awesome job\nIf it made more money than being an engineer than I would bake forever.\nWell I am sure with the industrialization of baking, they hire fewer people and use machines in huge factories\nIt's sad that less bread is made in a less fake, manufactured way.
I love ferrari's I have riven quite  a few before. I like the red one espicially.
Childcare involve supervision of children from ages 6 weeks to 13\nI have two small children in that age range. How about you?\nI have 1 child in that age range and use to have a child around that age but he's 5 now and it also involves nannies, baby sitters, teachers, and day care centers.   It's so hard to find a good one too huh?\nIt really is! We had to put both of my kids (4, 6) into different schools just because they each specialize in something different. Plus, we have had to have help from family members when daycare times are crazy.\nEarly childcare is such an important part of a babies life too and development.  Just finding the right care that you can trust is so crucial\nCompletely agree. We tried one daycare for my youngest and I didn't think they were providing enough education. Even though they were great people, we had to move out. Have you ever had to leave a child supervision facility for a similar reason?\nOh yeah at one place we left because he was being abused.   I sometimes just turn to extended family such as my mother, mother and law, sister if I'm lucky.  Sheesh it's just so frustrating.\nI am so sorry to hear that! I can't imagine! I really believe that there should be strict rules and policies in place for those situations!

Brown hair has high levels of a dark pigment and low levels of a pale pigment.\nI wonder if two people with brown hair can have a child with different color hair than its parents\nThat's true. If they both have a recessive gene for blonde hair, their child can be blonde!\nI wonder in which parts of the world brown hair is most common

I love Snoop Dogg, he's my favorite rapper. His real name is actually Calvin Cordozar Broadus, much easier to say Snoop Dogg though.\nI can't say I listen to his music at all, but I still respect him as an artist.\nI think that's a fair and respectable attitude to have. You certainly can't deny his success, having sold over 35 million albums worldwide after all.\nI don't think that number even accounts for all of the collaborations he's done with other artists.
My dog loves homemade dog bisquits, I get him one from a bakery every day.

I love the Italian car maker called Ferrari. They make some of the most iconic supercars in the world! What car brands do you like?\nI like to watch races .

Do you have any advice about hair coloring?
Red the color at the end of the visible light spectrum looks good on everyone. Don't you think?\nI am more of a fan of green.

I would start with that.\nIs that what you started with? I remember being little and my grandmother would give me a small chunk of dough to play with.
Hi, do you like Ferrari's?
As weird as it might sound, sometimes I imagine heaven being a giant bowl of never ending pasta. And I just wade in marinara sauce for eternity, slurping noodles. Weird, yeah?\n) is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine, with the first reference dating to 1154 \nWell, I can't be the only one who's had this fantasy then. 1154 is a long time ago. Did they make it similar to how it is done in modern times?\nFresh pasta was traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines\nInteresting. What is the most popular form of pasta? I would guess spaghetti, but I don't really know.\nYeah! Spagetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta\nWell, we both know Italy is famous for pasta. Are there any other countries who make their own version?\nSignificant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, maize and sugar beet\nThose ingredients must have really helped bring pasta to the next level. I wonder if sailors ate pasta.
my favorite color is red \nVery nice. It's a strong color to pick to be infatuated with, as it's a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model. Little do people know, though, is that it's a complementary color of cyan\noh that i did not know, anything else you can tell me about the color red ?\nIt's one of the colors that's at the end of the visible spectrum of light, sitting right next to orange, and opposite of violet. Its wavelength is dominant, with nanometres of 625 to 740. So, it's obviously a strong color, which is why some people like it.\ndo you see the color red in nature a lot ?\nWell, for example, you'll see red in the sky at times due to the Rayleigh scattering, and you'll see red in the Grand Canyon and other geological features because of hematite or red ochre, which come from iron oxide. These are just a couple of examples, but red is very present in nature.\noh wow thats cool
Red is such a pretty color, don't you think?\nI like that its wavelenght is 625-740 nanometres.\nOh wow! That's a new one for me! How many different shades are there?\nI am not sure but red is a primary color.\nYep, along with yellow and blue right?

I love wine tastings, what about you?\nPersonally, I am not much of a drinker; but I do know a little about wine tasting.  It has been around forever, it seems.  But the methodology of it today was really established around the 14th century.  Do you have a preference on wine?\nI like red wines most of all but will try it all. I am not big on drinking either, though\nThe white wines have a long history, too.  The white wines have been around for nearly 2,500 years, and they are produced through the fermentation of non-colored pulps of grapes.  Do you ever use wine in your cooking?\nI have never dabbled with wine in cooking but would like to\nYes; I actually replace the wine with white grape juice in my cooking.  Sparkling wine is another style of wine that is used basically with carbon dioxide.  It makes it all fizzy and fun!\nI would never thought of that! It's a great idea. Do you know any other fun facts?
I've been really stressed lately. Does it ever happen to you that you eat way too much when in stress?\nSometimes.  I am definitely more impulsive when I'm stressed out.\nMe too, I just act on a whim when stressed sometimes. however even though stress can be horrible, sometimes it may be beneficial too, for example in competetive situations.\nI agree.  Sometimes stress can help me be more motivated as well - if I have an upcoming deadline for example.  \nIt does play a role in motivation, as well as adaptation to the environment. I myself started thinking of stress as a more positive thing, in the past I used to only focus on the discomfort.\nIn what ways has it been positive in your life recently\nLately my wife and I have been apart for work related reasons, I decided to take on eudaimonic perspective, in psychology it's the concept of a "good life", living according to greatest values in life, and thought to myself the stress motivation can help me finish up working faster and come back to my wife while appreciating I have a job.\nThat must be tough - being away from each other for extended periods at a time.  My girlfriend and I had to spend two years apart while I studied abroad so I know the struggle.
Hey, how do you feel about weird hair? I've done some hair coloring, or hair dying, and I have changed to purple hair. \nI think hair coloring is cool. My youngest daughter has had pink hair.

I like to shop at Target. It's actually the second largest discount store in the US, next to Walmart.\nI also love Target, they are so clean inside.\nYes, and items are a bit different. It used to be named Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902 when it was first opened, and went through a few more names until 1910\nSo it officially became Target in 1910?\nWell, the actual first Target opened in Minnesota in 1962, but the parent company was renamed Dayton Corporation in 1967. It's been a process!\nHow many Target stores are there in the USA?

The American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls are entirely on the American side.\nif I remember right, the falls are in Buffalo
I really enjoy baking.  I actually used to work in a bakery when I was in college\nI love baking but I'm just a beginner.  What do you like to bake?\nI really like baking croissants.

I know it can be a big issue during the holidays, as many people tend to overeat during those times.\nThat's true, since there are so many gigantic meals during that time and people don't care as much.\nIt can also happen during festivals because people have built up so much anticipation to the event, and we even encourage overeating sometimes, for instance Thanksgiving.\nWe certainly do encourage overeating in some cases, but it seems to be very rare and it seems like weight loss stuff is really popular around that time too.\nWell I think the market for weight loss programs goes up during that time because they know people will be feeling bad about overeating probably, there's even 12-step programs for overeaters like Overeaters Anonymous.\nI would bet that you're right about that. People get very self conscious around the holidays because of all the food.

So when you fish them they are literal battles to reel them in.\nI can see that, yeah, they're huge. Aren't they a protected species though? At least in international waters?\nWell this was just off the Texas coast and it was fresh water. I dont think they were protected the boat captain made it seem like they were more of a problem than anything.

I will try to get over my irrational fears. But you said "most cases".

Jazz doesn't make any sense to me.  Is there any order to it at all?\nI love Jazz music but didn't get it at first.  Its so nice to listen to with its combo of swing and blue notes. Its very versatile.\nI don't even know what blues music is, what is that?\nIts a genre of music that was started by African Americans in the Deep South. You should really check it out but its not for everyone.  Jazz is a bit more easy listening.\nJazz just sounds like a lot of noise to me which makes me think it is some sort of modern statement or something.  Is it a newer style of music?\nIts not too old but the Jazz Age was in the 1920's. That's when it really started to be seen as a big form of musical expression.  I would start with some smooth Jazz to get used to it. Its easy listening.\nKenny G is the only jazz artist I really know.  Is Kenny G smooth jazz?\nHis music does have some Jazz elements and is definitely easy listening but he's really just a saxophonist more than anything else. But the saxophone is definitely part of Jazz!  So see, you like a form of Jazz. You are just missing the blues.\nI didn't say I like Kenny G.

What about you?\ni like Rock and roll because it developed from the music of gospel and blues in the 1940's and 1950's.\nYeah, I think Elvis had a lot to do with the invention of rock. Can you tell me about him?\nDo you mean  Elvis Aaron Presley, the American singer and actor?\nThat's the one. I think his nickname was the king of rock 'n roll.\nI had just heard of him being "The King".  There probably would not have been a Sun Records if not for Elvis and Sam Phillips.\nHe was revolutionary for his time. Many older people thought he was straight from the devil.\nI would love to hear one of his 2 Sun Record recordings that did not survive.  There could have been a hit we never heard!!\nYeah, some people still think he is alive. Who knows, I guess it's possible.
I really like to listen the gospel music, how about you?\nSince it is a genre of Christian music I'm not a huge fan myself.\nOhh, but you should listen at least once.\nI have listened to it, but the whole appeal of music geared towards both aesthetic and religion doesn't really appeal to me.\nI am myself not a christian, but yes I listen to all kinds of music, listen to 'Aretha Franklin Precious Lord, Part 1', I bet you'll like it\nI might have to try that and see if it changes my mind. One thing that is interesting is that it is as old as the early 17th century!\nyes, I that's what I think. I like the vintage kind of feel I get, when I listen to Gospel\nI can see that. Churches rely often on clapping and stomping for the rhythm in gospel music.\nHave you ever been to church. I went there just to listen the music. It feels great!

It's probably the most common thing people like to make. A classic for sure! You ever eat fresh baked bread?\nYup! I actually used to have one of those bread makers too lol. I haven't eaten as much bread as I used to though. It messes with my diet\nIt takes some practice to make. Because the heat slowly is transferred from the outside to the inside, it's hard to tell if they are cooked all the way through sometimes.\nTrue. It's the same way with a lot of baked goods as well in that respect \nThroughout history baking has been kind of a social role for women, but I'm a guy and love to bake. Oddly enough though it's usually men who bake commercially. Strange isn't it?\nBaking is a genderless passion. Anyone who enjoys it should be able to do so. But, it's always been the 'cooking and cleaning' social role that makes everyone associate it with only women. There aren't only women chefs though :=)

But as far as *changing* my color by dyeing it -- I haven't been tempted yet! But it's nice to know there are options!\nYes since you don't feel comfortable with the color of your hair, dyeing can be an option\nIt's not that I don't feel comfortable -- I just sometimes want to do something *different*. It's super common, obviously, in the Western world -- but variety can be fun.\nYes variety can be fun really, sometimes you just feel like doing something different\nI mean, as a brunette I have thicker hair than blondes typically do -- but not as much as redheads. Speaking of...red could be fun! Is there a color you like?\nI like black color with a such of golden

I guess you're talking about the Stephen King movie, It?\nThat is correct. Pennywise looks so creepy. I know it's just a movie but I'm afraid there is a real killer clown.\nWell, yeah there actually were a bunch of clown sightings in 2016, but I think it was just people messing around.\nI hope so.

That definitely sounds like an interesting place to visit.

I just dyed my hair burgandy, kind of regretting it
I love Snoop Dogg, are you a fan of his music?\nSnoop has made a better living off of smoking Marijuana than Cheech and Chong ever did.  They don't get the respect they deserve, they were far ahead of their time.\nHaha, you are definitely right about that. I like his song Gin and Juice, have you heard of it?
I have been sober for four months now and feel great.\nCongratulations! Achieving your goal of not consuming alcohol is not easy, but you did it!\nI just stopped drinking wine.  It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.  Still miss it with nice dinners though.
Hey are you considered obese? \nNo, but I know some people that are.  It seems pretty common.\nWell its when you Body mass index (BMI) is at a certain level. I'm glad i'm not there although i am considered overweight. \nYeah, I could stand to lose a few myself.  What else do you know about it?\nThat it has inverse effects on your health like, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and depression.\nMy husband has sleep apnea, although he is not obese - so I guess it can just make you more prone to some of these things?
Niagara Falls are beautiful this time of year. Have you ever been?\nI have not! My parents have been several times. They enjoy going to the city of Niagra Falls in Ontario, Canada!\nWonderful. Many couples get engaged while visiting the Niagara Falls. It is such a romantic spot!\nThat would make sense, as the smallest of the 3 falls is called Bridal Veil Falls!\nWow, I did not know that was an actual name. I wonder how many proposals have happened there!\nI am not sure. There are several Bridal Veil falls throughout the USA though. I know of one in WA state, and one in Oregon. You can actually go to the Bridal Veil ghost town in Oregon and get your wedding invitations stamped!\nThat is so interesting. Your knowledge is definitely encyclopedic. I would love to visit a real ghost town one day.
I've never been to a Comic-Con, but the San Diego one seems interesting.\nI hear it's the best one.  I'd be interested in going but it is too far away.\nMe too! It began in 1970, making it one of the oldest Comic-Cons.\nThat is the comic-con that Adam Savage from Mythbusters always dresses up in a costume. People there try to figure out which one he is.\nThat's hilarious. I'd loved the television series, "Mythbusters"\nIndeed, it was a good one.  My favorite costume of his was the space suit from 2001 Space Odyssey with a working air pump backpack thing!\nI liked it when they tried to bust famous movie references, like is a martini actually better "shaken, not stirred"\nYes, or the one where they tried to curve a bullet by firing from a moving gun. Comic-Con brings a lot of people with the same interests together to talk about stuff like this.
I'm thinking of buying a Ferrari - I hear that it's a pretty fast car!
We had circus in the area last week.  I am not a fan of the clowns. Are you? \nClowns are very interesting and oftentimes come with different costumes and performances. I enjoy them.\nthe comedy style of clowns , playing the fool, has a long history in many countries. \nThey have a pretty rich history. These comic performers often use slapstick methods for laughs\nI think the fear of clowns is a psychiatric condition that is called coulrophobia. \nThat's an interesting tidbit. The modern clown is closely tied with the circus clown, which grew out of earlier theatrical performances\nYeah, I guess there are different types. The white makeup and big red mouth are what creep me out, plus some horror movies. 
I love gospel music: james Brown sang gospel in the movie "the Blues Brothers", and it was awe inspiring.\nI'm not really into Gospel music. I prefer country music\ngospel is simply a form of the genre of Christian music.  Some people get it, others don't.\nWell i love christian music but not baptist type of music with a lot of yelling. i prefer classical hymns
7 is my favourite lucky number!\nReally, well you will find it cool that various Hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase J vertically inverted.\nReally? What other cultures have history with the letter?\nWell, the western Ghubar Arabs' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight, though they showed some tendencies to making the character more rectilinear.\nCool! I always wondered why the letter looked the way it did!
I enjoy rock and roll music. I recently took a trip to the Rock and Roll hall of fame which was fantastic. Do you like rock music?\nI do! I especially love Classic Rock and the sound of the electric guitars\nYEah, Led Zepplin, The Guess Who- those guys were great. Modern rock is so different. I can't stand Fall Out Boy, for example. \nI agree! Some of the new type of music nowadays I just don't understand. I miss just the classic saxophone or piano in some of the current music.\nIt seems like all music is auto-tuned these days- you would never have heard that in Classic Rock. 
I like Snoop Dogg's music. Specifically drop it like its hot
I really enjoy chili peppers in my meals because it proves the kick I like.\nOh dude, I love hot and spicy food. Sign me up! What was the last spicy stuff you ate?
I love pasta if I could eat it everyday I would the noodles and flour taste just gets me I'm a starchy kind of girl lol.\nI love mac and cheese. Any kinda carb really lol.\nHow about dumplings I love homemade dumplings with chicken, potatoes and fresh vegetables. \nI like them when they are cooked the right way. I don't like them dry. I wish I could make them. \nI totally agree some people like theirs fried I prefer mines in a creamy sauce boiling, simmering and steaming to get all the flavors lol.\nYes that's how I like them also. I've never had them fried.\nI have once at this restaurant they just add banku and kenkey and roll the dough into little balls and deep fry them. \nI've never heard of that, what is it?
Hey there.  What kind of baked foods do you like?\nI enjoy baking bread. It is the most common baked item.\nWhat type of bread do you bake?\nI like baking garlic bread and then also combining it with grilling to produce a hybrid variant by using one method after the other.\nWow that sounds delicous, I would love to try it. You are making me hungry right now.\nIt's best when you use a french baguette and slice it only partially downwards, allowing the condiments to soak in. I am making myself hungry as well.\nI need to head to a bakery tomorrow.  I sadly don't know how to bake that type of bread myself.\nI am sure you can find something very tasty at the bakery. There will be baked goods prepared by a baker.\nWhat other baked goods beside bread do you like? 
I really love comic books. Have you ever been to San Diego Comic-Con? \nI know it's held annually, but I've never been.  Tell me about it!\nPeople from all over the country, and sometimes other countries, show up and wait in lines for hours to meet famous artists and actors. \nIt's a 4 day even in July in San Diego, so I'd think it's one of the larger comic-cons.\nI've heard that before. I think the only other large one is New York Comic-Con. I hear they have exclusive items to buy there. 
Can you believe that I turn 37 next week, yet I've never had any alcohol before?
Gouda cheese is pretty good, its named after a city in the Netherlands.\ni dont think ive had it. is it yellow ish or white ish like mozzarella?\nMore yellowish.

Ive been driving a ferrari for 28 years, Some call me the Ferrari expert, anything youd like to know about them? \nWhat's the price range on those bad boys?\nWell if you buy an Italian version it runs about 300K,  Ferraris are manufactured here where I live in Maranello.\nWhere exactly is Maranello?\nMaranello is a little town in the region of Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy, about 18 km from Modena, the population here is 17,165 as of 2013.\nOh ok, It sounds really nice. So how many different types of ferraris are there?
Is it true Wine tasting is a delicate art?\nYou could say so, however, results have surfaced that definitely tend to contradict the reliability of wine tasting.  Blind testing has identified many inconsistencies.\nWhat do you mean by reliability?\nWell there used to be a recognized system that people thought was concrete surrounding wine testing.  But recently scientists have been exploring the objective parameters of the human olfactory system.\nHow exactly is wine tasting done?
jazz music is a very interesting sound and interesting genre. what can you tell me about it\nI like jazz too. It originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and 20th centuries\nawesome im from there. i basically invented jazz then. but anyways where is jazz famous like countries?\nIt is popular around the world. As it spread across the globe, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, giving rise to many distinctive styles\nJazz\nIt's been hailed as "one of America's original art forms"\ninteresting. who is a famous jazz artist?
I've never really thought much about childcare or daycare for children under six and up to 13 weeks. I am still young. Yourself?\nI don't know much about childcare. Is it rated somehow so you know you are getting a good one?
One time I died my hair blonde because I was tired of being a brunette. Have you ever changed your hair color?\nYes i have i like to died  my hair brown sometimes and maybe a little blond\nDid you do it yourself, or have it professionally done? \nI had it done by a professional, one time i tried it myself and it looked horrible\nYeah, I don't think I would trust myself doing it at home. I know many people at work who dye their hair wanting to hide grey hairs. \nWhat exactly do professional hair stylist do other than to died hair\nProfessional hair stylist also cut and style hair too. They don't just dye hair. \nWhen has the last time you dyed your hair?
I've always found 7, the number between 6 and 8, to be a lucky number for me. \ni love the number 7 too.\nSometimes in the western world people draw a horizontal stroke through the middle of the 7, but you never see that on a keyboard.\nthats quite cool.\nI guess it helps to distinguish a 7 from a 1, if you have bad handwriting like I do!  \nyea i know what you mean.
I'm looking for a new recipe and want to experiment with gouda cheese.  Do you have any ideas?\nIt's such a mild Dutch cheese, that it goes well with lots of things. You can even just melt it on toast!\nSo it's mild.  That's great to know. What else can you tell me about gouda?\nIt's very old, going all the way back to the Middle Ages. The first recorded mention of it is from 1184.\n1184?  That's amazing.  I had no idea about the history of gouda.  I've wanted to cook with it for a while now, but it's expensive.\nIndeed, the price of Gouda has been disputed a long time. In the Middle Ages, buyers negotiated price with a system called "handjeklap," which involved clapping hands and shouting prices.\nThat is so interesting.  I wish I could negotiate the price at my local grocery store:)
People don't think enough about early child care.  Quaility care at a young age can have a big impact on the child's future success.\nI agree my kids have been in daycare from 2 months and up and once my oldest got age 2 I changed her to a private christian academy education is so important. \nTypically children are taken care of by parents or siblings, but daycare is very popular in the U.S.\nIt became popular because of the fact parents have to go to work the rates are sky high as well. 
Hello

Some dog biscuit makers say that their products are good for dog's teeth - they help clean them\ninteresting. and...what would happen if a human ate them? ....like, all the time?
7 is my favourite lucky number!\nReally, well you will find it cool that various Hindus wrote 7 more or less in one stroke as a curve that looks like an uppercase J vertically inverted.\nReally? What other cultures have history with the letter?\nWell, the western Ghubar Arabs' main contribution was to make the longer line diagonal rather than straight, though they showed some tendencies to making the character more rectilinear.\nCool! I always wondered why the letter looked the way it did!\nWell this is analogous to the horizontal stroke through the middle that is sometimes used in handwriting in the Western world but which is almost never used in computer fonts.\nInteresting!\nAnother cool point, both modern Arab forms influenced the European form, a two-stroke character consisting of a horizontal upper line joined at its right to a line going down to the bottom left corner, a line that is slightly curved in some font variants.\nToooo cool! I look at the number in such a different way!
I just dyed my hair burgandy, kind of regretting it\nOh wow!  Did you have it done  professionally by a hairdresser or did you do it yourself at home?\nI did it at home and obviously did not think it through, Burgandy is not a natural hair color so it looks weird\nInterestingly, in 2016 sales for home coloring kits were close to $2.2 billion!  So you're probably not the only one to choose a, shall we say, unfortunate color!\nWell at least I picked a good brand, Loreal, the cheap brands will burn and damage hair
I've got light brown hair, and my wife has naturally slightly darker brown.  I wonder if people tend to pair with people with the same hair color.\nI'm not so sure about that. I have brown hair, but hubby has black hair. \nI guess it's a silly thought, but sometimes I have them :P  Fun fact, your husband has more hair follicles because of their black hair?\nReally? I didn't know that. I guess that explains why his hair is much thicker then mine. \nYeah, it would be that.  It's probably one of his defining characteristics :P\nYes, I have always loved his hair. Even if it is turning grey now. lol
I am afraid of Manta ray while swimming in warm, tropical waters.\nI got to swim with manta rays once. It was a great experience. Where can I usually find Manta Rays in the world?

I love science fiction movies about extraterrestrial and alien invasion\nThey certainly seem interesting though I don't watch them often, do you have a favorite science fiction movie in particular?\n"War of the Worlds" written by H G Wells and starring Tom Cruise is a favorite!\nOh I think I've heard of it, I'm pretty sure it's famous. Around what time did that movie come out?\nNot sure? Another good one is Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1959\nThat certainly has an interesting title, it must have interesting special effects since it's so old. Do you know what the plot of War of the Worlds is?
pasta is a staple italian food\nPasta is so good, especially with tomato sauce.\npasta is great and has been around since 1154\nWow that's so long! I wonder if it is the same as back then.\nyea and it pasta was founded in italy, sicily\nThat makes sense, since pasta is so prevalent in Italian cuisine.
Hi, I am terribly afraid of clowns since I was a child, do you know the comic performers?\nYes, i'm not scared personally but they just annoy me so much hahaha, is there any history behind clowns?\nYes there is a history, but it's varied because of so many differences in costumes and performances.\nwow, when i was young my parents dressed me as a clown and i think that i s the reason i hate them, what about you?\nMy parents booked one for a birthday party when I was 9 and his style was creepy to me. It turned me off to it, but i think movies helped me acquire my fear of them.\nhahahah yea i know movies make it so much worse, but overall i'ts a way to make a living and i respect that

What is your favorite number? Mine is the number 7\nI like 7, seems pretty cool. I mean it comes after 6 and before 8.\nI just remembered a joke from when I was a Kid. "Why was 6 afraid of 7?'
I used to have quite the issue with overeating, especially since I had no idea how much calories were in certain foods.\nI know what you mean. Certain foods can be addicting too. and that is the compulsive consumption of a high fat and high sugar food or foods which activate a reward center in the brain\nYeah, they're so much easier to access than before since sweet foods are thought of by the body as occasional treats.
I love the number 7.  What do you think about that?\nYeah its a good number.  Comes after 6 and before 8 lol.  What do you like about it? Has it been lucky for you?\nIt has been lucky for me and I like that it is used in slot machines.

Ferraris are extremely expensive italian sports cars.  Have you ever owned one?\nI wish, it's my dream car. Do you know who founded the company?\nFounded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939.  They also manufacture Fiats, which are more in my price range.\nI used to think Fiat was French just like Peugot, I never knew it was Italian. Wow amazing\nFerrari was actually branded as the worlds most powerful in 2014.  \nI think they are too expensive. I have seen more of Lamborghini than I have Ferrari, I think because of their exclusivity. 
I love to color my hair. I recently colored it purple.\nHow interesting! Did you do it yourself or did you go to a professional?\nI did it myself at home. Do you have any advice on how to maintain it?\nThere are special shampoos and conditioners. Won't be hard to find them in the store because hair coloring products are a 1.9 billion dollar business in the U.S.!\nWow, that's a lot of money. It can be stressful dying your hair by yourself. I wonder how they dyed it in ancient times.\nThey likely used Natural dyes, which can be from vegetables and plant sources like roots, bark, leaves, berries and wood. You can also find dyes in fungi and lichens!\nWow, that's probrably safer than putting a bunch of chemicals in your hair. Do the chemicals in modern hair dyes have any adverse effects?
Do you believe that there will ever be an alien invasion?\nno. only in science fiction stories and movies lol \namazing, since you are quite knowledgeable, how do we define an alien invasion? \nit's simply aliens invade the Earth either to exterminate human life or harvest people for food, steal the planet's resourses\nWhen did this word ever come into play? have there been any sightings? or it's just a figment of someone's imagination
Dog biscuit is a snack  that is used as a supplement for dogs\nI give my dogs biscuit sometimes. How healthy are dog treats though? \nJudging by the fact that they are always well made, and  tend to be hard and dry, I would say they are healthy\nI guess that makes sense. What other supplements exist to give to your dog? 
Sobriety is an issue that is difficult for many individuals.\nWold you like to know the definition of sobriety?\nYes, please tell me the definition.\nthe condition of not having effects from alcohol. It is the state of being sober.\nYes, I believe that staying sober is difficult for many people.\nI read that it is natural state of a human being given at a birth. I do not quite agree with that statement.\nI was married to an alcoholic who struggled with staying sober for almost 20 years. Even after rehab, he still struggles.\nDo you agree with the statement "the natural state of a human being given at a birth"?  \nAlthough this is the first time I have ever heard that statement, I believe that there are many factors that contribute to dependency issues later in life.
I don't drink alcohol at all, I'm all about sobriety\nThats a good choice. Alcohol is just never the answer for anything.
I have always dreamed of owning a Ferrari\nOh, luxury. It's an Italian sports car manufacturer in Maranello.\nOh yes. Do you know what kind of engine it has?\nI'm not sure.

I must admit I have gotten into baking recently.  The most common item baked is bread, but I have been branching out a little.\nWhere have you recently branched to? I want to learn how to bake too\nWell I have gotten a lot of ideas from the Great British Bake off, which is a cooking show where bakers compete against each other\nTell me more about the cooking show at be that could help me\nThe contestants go through three challenges for baking and each episode some are eliminated\nSo do they bake bread only or are there any other stuff they do?

I did know that red cars are more popular so they tend to be higher priced!\nAbsolutely, red and other colors can be highly influential for people. I'm sure you've heard that thing about red cars being pulled over more often.\nYes! It is crazy how colors can be so influential!
Everyday after work I give my dog a biscuit. She likes them a lot. I think she likes how crunchy they are, as biscuits are hard and dry.\nooook?? well that's nice to know. are dog biscuits good for dogs?\nYes! Some dog biscuit makers say that their products are good for dog's teeth - they help clean them\ninteresting. and...what would happen if a human ate them? ....like, all the time?\nWell 'dog's bread' as dog biscuits used to be called since Roman times were made of bran. They'd keep your bowels as clean as a whistle\nwell then maybe I should dig into my sister's dog's biscuits and see what happens. what other types of food are good for dogs?

I hear brown hair is pretty common there.\nyes she is, she used to use Henna to dye her hair red. i mean it wasn't really red it just looked brown with red tint\nThat's pretty cool, I didn't know you could use Henna to dye hair.

Are fat people funiier? Maybe. what do you think?\nI am not too familiar with the fat acceptance movement. Obesity is terrible for your health, so why accept it?\nWhy not accept it? Is it any of your business if someone is fat or not? Does it affect you, really?\nI am obese myself and have abdominal obesity for sure, so yes it it my business.\nAnd you don't think people should accept you? Should they throw rocks or something? Or not serve you at restaurants? You have hate yourself because you're fat?\nNo I think you shouls accept others fornwho they are. But onesity is causing heart disease all over the country.\nIt seems to be a symptom of something larger, psychological, environmental, lifestyles. Shaming people isn't going to help. People need other options and people to care for them.

Hi
Gosh I just love the comic con, especially the one in San Diego that celebrates every year!\nwho is your favorite character!
Red is one of my favorite colors. Its at the end of the visible spectrum.\nIt's never been one I've gravitated towards. But I'm open to learning more about all colors. What can you tell me about it to get me interested?
My favorite color is red. I think it looks great by itself or contrasted with blue. Do you like red?\nI love red from the bluish-red of crimson to the yellow tinged scarlet, it is probably the most prominent color.\nYes, there are so many shades of red. I think my favorite one is firehouse red, which is very bright and luminous. Red is also a primary color.
Childcare involve supervision of children from ages 6 weeks to 13\nI have two small children in that age range. How about you?
Red is my favorite color.  It is known for being at the end of the visible spectrum of light.\nIsn't the color red supposed to excite and inflame the passions?\nYes that is true.  I've also heard it increases blood pressure!\nI understand it is not to be used, or used sparingly in classrooms.\nI have never heard that?  Where did you read that?\nTeacher school!
i wish i could lose weight, i'm so obese 
So i have a little bakery with my wife 24 cupcakes, we bake from day to night, do you like to bake?\nI bake bread which is the most common item to bake, but that's it.\nOh thats cool, good old bread one of the oldes recipes, from Jesus christ times there was bread, so baking is really old! do you like baked sweets? cupcakes cakes? 
do u like ferrari , i hear they are super expensive \nThey are expensive but worth it, they were rated the most pwerful brand by brand france in 2014\npersonally i doubt i can ever afford one , but rich people talk about \nI feel it's name is what makes it popular the most. Brands are used in marketing and advertising to make people want to buy them.\nits good advertisement , everyone who is rich wants one \nI'd rather have a new ford mustang myself.\none day you will , just keep working hard and you will get it 
I love the color red,red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light\nI love red too! Red is my favorite color!

My favorite color is red. I think it looks great by itself or contrasted with blue. Do you like red?\nI love red from the bluish-red of crimson to the yellow tinged scarlet, it is probably the most prominent color.\nYes, there are so many shades of red. I think my favorite one is firehouse red, which is very bright and luminous. Red is also a primary color.\nYea its been a big part across many cultures due to it being the color of blood, it was used in Mayans and Egyptians ceremonies, as well as by the Romans.\nThat is a great point. They must have attached a lot of significance to red. I wonder if they even dressed in red.\nActually red became a big color for costumes and outfits in the Renaissance period among nobility and royalty.\nInteresting. I think of Mardi Gras today where there are many revelers wearing red. It is a very festive color!
I've always found 7, the number between 6 and 8, to be a lucky number for me. \ni love the number 7 too.\nSometimes in the western world people draw a horizontal stroke through the middle of the 7, but you never see that on a keyboard.\nthats quite cool.\nI guess it helps to distinguish a 7 from a 1, if you have bad handwriting like I do!  \nyea i know what you mean.\nQuite a few cultures, including Hindus, have written the 7 in similar ways to how we do it. The Hindus originally wrote it like an inverted J. \nthats a cool way to look at it, strange it was from hindus tho.
Gosh, i really want to buy a ferrari one day! It's my dream car\nFerrari is rated the world's most powerful brand \nSuch a beautiful car! They are so expensive though\nThe 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history in May 2012\nWow, really? Do you know how much that Ferrari cost?\nIt sold for a little bit over $38 million\nThat's a lot of money!!!

I am a retired programmer, do you know something about programming, have you ever tried it?\nNo, but I remember sitting and watching my mom type in several pages worth of code into an old comodor computer and all that happened was a horse ran across the screen. \nYes its really a hard work, thats the reason i retired, and also everybody is doing it these days, so my pay went down\nYes, it does seem to be common these days.  I homeschool and they even have how to code books for little kids. \nYes, i imagine in the future its the only thing humans will do.. i get sad thinking about it \nYes it is. I prefer to let my kids read things like National Geographic kids. I actually like it myself. \nYes my favorite channel is NatGeo, i think its the fact that i work from my pc and dont go out often :D
I love pasta! It is a must have for Italians! My favorite is plain noodles with butter and Parmesan cheese. \nI love pasta too and am also Italian background! But I prefer it with marinara sauce. \nButter and Parmesan is one of the oldest ways to serve pasta.\nI did not know that, maybe I should try it sometime. What other foods do you like?\nI do also like fettuccine alfredo, which is a spin-off of butter and parmesan noodles, made popular in the mid 20th century.\nYou know a lot about pasta! My grandparents used to make their pasta at home from scratch, I always found that the most delicious. \nHomemade pasta really is the best! I love italian food.

I am bored of my maids.\nWhy? The word maid is short for maiden, meaning virgin. Do you know how that evolved into someone cleaning the house?\nI don't know I just need a change I guess. How did that evolve into someone who cleans a house?\nI'm not sure. I was hoping you knew. In Victorian times the maids were expected to remain unmarried.\nWhy did they need to remain unmarried?\nBecause they needed to devote all their time to the household. Even the highest-ranking workers, like butlers, could be dismissed if they married.\nWoW! I did not know that. That's almost equivalent to a slave!\nIt sure is. They used to suffer from bursitis because of all the time spent on their knees scrubbing and lighting the fires.\nWhen did it stop being that way?
I love going on wine tasting tours in the Niagara region\nI've never gone wine tasting before but I know about it.\nIt is a great experience.  Not only do you get buzzed but you learn how to drink wine properly.  It sounds pompous but it really makes a difference.\nIt really does sound like a great time, as it is a sensory evaluation of the wine.\nDepending on where the wine hits your tongue it tastes completely different.  This is why different types of wine are served in different glasses \nI know what you mean. Also, wine tasting has been around since ancient times.\nDid the Romans or Greeks have wine tastings similar to common day wine tastings?\nNot really, since wine tasting has been around since the 14th century.\nWhere and how did it originate?  I always assumed the Romans had a hand in it. 
There is a real issue with obesity in the US.  Right?\nYes, obesity in the United States has been increasingly cited as a major health issue.\nWhat kind of health issues are there associated with obesity?\nWell, obesity causes diseases like coronary heart diseases, which can lead to mortality.\nWow, that is definitely not good.  What is the best thing someone can do to fight obesity?\nWell on a personal level there is diet in exercise, but you could also support organizations like The Biggest Loser\nInteresting.  I find it sort of sad that people seem to embrace this condition and almost feel proud to be obese.  I wonder why this occurs?
I'm doing my internship at a day care center.\nChild care children child minding \nYes, we work to develop early childhood skills. \ndaycare is the caring for and supervision of a child or children\nYes, we do supervise them, but we also work on developmental milestones with them.\nChild care is a broad topic\nDo you care for any children?\nEarly child care is an equally important and often overlooked component of child development\nIndeed it is, and a very expensive necessity for many families.

I have quite a lot of energy, but I know some people just aren't as lucky. Is their a medical condition for being constantly tired?\nI think it's called Chronic Fatigue Syndrom, or CFS.  I don't know a lot about it, but it makes people tired for long-term amounts of time.\nThat must be awful. I wonder what causes it. Depression perhaps?\nI don't think the cause is fully understood.  It could be genetic, could be biological, or it could be psychological.\nWell, I guess the medical profession had better get to the bottom of it. It must be destroying people's lives!\nI'm sure it is, but people are starting to see that behavioral therapy and a slow increase in activity can help counteract the effects.\nThat makes sense. If a person exercises it often brings ones energy levels up.
7 is my favorite number it means so much to me

Do you think they are healthy?\nI'm kind of torn, I think probably they aren't, but the hard and dry texture probably helps clean their teeth, at least according to some manufacturers.\nI want to believe that, anyway I don't think one every day can cause much daamage, specially for a big dog like mine.

I'm interested in more obscure facts about the number if you've got any.

Do you know if there's anything special involved in making Gouda cheese?\nIt is made from cows milk and is one of the most popular cheeses around!\nWell I think most cheese are made from cows milk so that makes sense. Do you know if there's a town or city named Gouda? Maybe that's where the name comes from.
I've never been to a Comic-Con, but the San Diego one seems interesting.\nI hear it's the best one.  I'd be interested in going but it is too far away.\nMe too!

I think a lot of people want to blame obesity on the person, but I think some cases can be blamed on genes.  What do you think?\nI think that genes do have some to do with obesity with different health problems\nMe too the problems with obesity are obvious, as it can cause many diseases and conditions like type 2 diabetes and even cancer.\nIt can also lead to heart disease and stroke as well making it even harder to be active to not be obese..\nWhat really worries is child obesity, it is becoming more common and it is becoming a serious public health concern.\nI agree, children are being less active with having my electronics available to them so that can cause a bigger problem when someone may have a hypothyroid that is causing the obesity.\nTrue, I used to oppose a Sugary drink tax, but with increasing evidence that Cokes, sports drinks and energy drinks can lead to diabetes I would not oppose it now.\nI would support a tax on sugary drinks as well, it may cause more people to think about drinking water which could help with being obese and saving money.
I'm an old fashioned girl - I love rock and roll, especially 60s rock music.\nWhat's your favorite music group/singer from that era?\nI quite like Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, but I really love the Rolling Stones' music.\ngosh, I didn't realize the Rolling Stones were from the 60's.

It's the second most common color.\nI don't know if I want to be common though. Should I dye it so it's not brown anymore?\nWell if you want to get away from brown hair, why not try an unnatural color like cadet blue or purple?\nBecause if I dye it cadet blue, I'm worried that means I'll have to join the Air Force.\nOh!  you could perhaps move away from Europe and North America and move to, say Japan where it is way less common.

I have brown hair.\nMe too! Pretty much everybody in my family does, since we're all descendants of central Europeans.\nMost of my family has brown hair also.\nHave you ever tried to dye it? I attempted to dye my hair blue before, but it didn't take since my hair is so dark. I would probably have to bleach it to make it work.\nI have dyed my hair a few times with success. In order to do colorful or bright, it would need to be bleached first.\nYeah, that's probably the best idea. I'm a bit intimidated by trying to bleach it at home, though. I'd probably just go to a hairdresser at a salon to do it for me.\nUsing a hairdresser is probably the best option. I would be afraid to do it on my own.\nMe too!!! At least a hairdresser has some degree of training. If I can't manage to do it myself, might as well go to somebody licensed for it\nMy thoughts exactly!
I really love comic books. Have you ever been to San Diego Comic-Con? \nI know it's held annually, but I've never been.  Tell me about it!\nPeople from all over the country, and sometimes other countries, show up and wait in lines for hours to meet famous artists and actors. 
Not just because it has been cool since the late 1940s and early 1950s but I love rock and roll\nRock and roll seems so timeless, there is just so much to it!\nThat reminds me of that song, "I love Rock and Roll" by Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, now it will be stuck in my head lol.\nHaha, I forgot about that one,  I wonder how old that song is
I once swam with a Manta Ray when I was on vacation in Florida.\nNo way? That's the rays in the genus "manta" right? What was it like?\nWell I didn't realize it was there until I looked down.  It didn't seem to acknowledge my presenad and kept looking for more fish to eat.
I was thinking about purchasing a new vehicle and saw a nice red one I liked. Do you like red?\nYes I do, mostly because of the history behind the color. The red pigment was actually one of the first colors in prehistoric art.\nI remember reading that before, and it was quite a precious dye many years ago.\nAbsolutely, the history extends even to the Ancient Egyptians and Mayans, who colored their faces red during ceremonies!\nIt's amazing how the color can have so many different meanings, depending on the context.\nNot only so many meanings, but so many different hues itself, ranging from yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson even!\nTrue! I guess I mean how some see red and think of desire, others think of danger...
I love rock and roll music! It originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African American musical styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, along with country music.\nwhos your favorite musician?\nI love The Beatles! Rock and roll did not acquire its name until 1954.\nnice did not know that.  I'm more into the later music 90s and 2000s.\nInteresting. Music in the 2000s saw the creation or emergence of a few styles, such as indie-related genres such as Emo, Alternative R&B, and a multitude of new electronic subgenres, most notably Dubstep.\nSome great music has come out of that.  Hoepfully it just keeps getting better.\nI agree! The convergence of different styles was one of the more defining features of the 2000s, as seen with the creation and commercial success of the British Grime genre and Trap music and Chillwave in the United States.\nI'm just glad theres sites like amazon prime music so i can listen to variety and take them with me on my cell phone.
I love jazz. I listen to it whilst working and studying.

They are large rays that belong to the genus Manta.\nYes I have been in the water with rays before. They are majestic creatures.\nWhere were you in the water when you encountered the ray? I know they are found in temperate, subtropical and tropical waters.\nI was in Cozumel Mexico. We were on a snorkeling trip and say a school of eagle rays. They move so smooth and gracefully through the water.\nI find it kind of cool that they are filter feeders which means they eat zooplankton which they swallow as they swim with their mouths open! lol\nI did not know that, don't whales eat in a similar manner?

Because the heat slowly is transferred from the outside to the inside, it's hard to tell if they are cooked all the way through sometimes.\nTrue.

Although not necessarily fair it's true good looks go a long way.\nit's actually so interesting that some time ago "fitness" was defined as the capasity to carry out the day's activities\nReally interesting.

You would have to be in peak physical shape to make it that long though. \nYes, it is called water fasting \nSo do you work out often?

When did people start coding?\nDepends on what you consider coding, but in 1842, Ada Lovelace created an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli numbers in an analytical engine.\nShe sounds fascinating!  Can you tell me any more about her?\nSure, she was really the first person to realize that a simple device for calculation had far more applications than its original stated purpose.\nIt must have been tough for her, as a woman back then.  Are there any other people well known for coding?

I lost 45 pounds by changing my lifestyle and working out on a regular basis. Funny thing is I didn't feel obese at that time.\nThat's great that you have lost that much!

Hello, so what are your thoughts on pasta?\nI love pasta, it is such a versatile food! I really enjoy Italian food for its great flavors, and of course, it involves lots of pasta!\nTrue, me too.  We have an Italian shop around the corner and I see them making fresh pasta.  Delicious!\nOh wow I have never seen that before! How do they make fresh pasta?\nIt's working the pasta dough and flattening or elongating it with a pasta machine attached to a bench.  What pastas do you usually get>?\nInteresting, I didn't know that, thanks! I typically get traditional pasta, like fettuccine, with Alfredo sauce. What about you?\nRigatoni, angel hair (my favorite), and tortellini are some of my favs.  As for sauces, I love alfredo, but a good tomato sauce is great too!\nThose are all delicious. I love tortellini because they are filled with a ton of delicious things. Whats your favorite type of tortellini?\nI like a simple cheese tortellini.  Although I've recently been exploring a spicy tofu veggie and cheese version.  Hard to make but delicious!

Is it true Wine tasting is a delicate art?\nYou could say so, however, results have surfaced that definitely tend to contradict the reliability of wine tasting.  Blind testing has identified many inconsistencies.\nWhat do you mean by reliability?\nWell there used to be a recognized system that people thought was concrete surrounding wine testing.  But recently scientists have been exploring the objective parameters of the human olfactory system.\nHow exactly is wine tasting done?\nTypically the wine tasters will all sip the wine, then use an ever evolving system of terminology to describe the aromas, flavors, and characteristics of the wine.\nSounds like a very niche hobby.

It's an awesome music genre with cool African-American roots which is what I love about it!\nJazz is fantastic, although it seems to have fallen from popularity since the 50's, where rock and roll took over.\nYeaha and in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it developed into blues and ragtime too.\nModern Jazz appears to be more inspired by those evolutions than the original Jazz that was prevalent in the 1920's

Strange but fascinating.\nI didnt know about this, well theres always ways to change the texture of the most common foods, sometimes when we do not have our hoven, we pan frye the bread, and taste simular to when you bake it!\nThat's amazing. I prefer the professional touch of home bakers, since now most baking is automated by machines in factories.\nYes you can taste the diference in the baking hoven, pizzerias for example bake in wooden hovens and tastes so unique!\nI definitely agree! I just found out that baking has traditionally been done by women at home, and by men in bakeries and restaurants. Kinda sexist but it's nice that it's different now.\nYes you know that usually hand made labor it was for women, but noadays one of the most famous bakery shops are own by men, like the ones you see on tv, so the world is changing while the hovens remain the same!

His real name is actually Calvin Cordozar Broadus, much easier to say Snoop Dogg though.\nI can't say I listen to his music at all, but I still respect him as an artist.\nI think that's a fair and respectable attitude to have. You certainly can't deny his success, having sold over 35 million albums worldwide after all.\nI don't think that number even accounts for all of the collaborations he's done with other artists.\nI'm sure you're right about that, he's definitely worked with a lot of other artists. I like his second album called Tha Doggfather a lot.\nI can't recall any of the songs of of that album.

I'm not sure when the first person got that bright idea, but it was probably far, far back\nWell actually it just started with someone pouring a jug of water, which was often very cold.

Chronic fatigue sounds rough, it brings long term fatigue and limits a person to carry out daily things.\nThat sound miserable.  What causes chronic fatigue?\nWhat is scary is they do not know the exact cause, its not even genetic or biological.\nInteresting.

Chronic usually means that it lasts for a long time, but just how long does it last on average?\nIt seems like it just depends on the person\nThat is quite concerning.  There must be an underlying cause and the fact that it is unknown is unnerving.  Are researchers still actively searching for the cause of it?

The color is fall\nI also like blue, which is the color of the sky and deep sea due to scattering of light.\nWhy is it the sky is blue unless you go up in a jet or space ship then it's clear.

It became more of a "thinkg" in the 14th century and has gotten more and more popular since.\nWhere did it start, Italy?\nI'm not sure.  But since it has such a temperate and Mediterranean climate, it is really great for growing grapes.  I guess that's why it's always been known for it.  \nWhat kind of grapes are used to make wine/

I love Snoop Dogg, do you know much about him?
I used to have really blonde hair but now it is very brown, which makes sense since it's the 2nd most common human hair color.\nI have naturally brown hair but had to much gray so I went blonde too.\nWell my hair is brown now, or brunette as a lot of people call it.\nHair is just the pgmentation of the follicles due to two types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin.\nI know, this pigmentation is what determines darker or paler hair colors.\nThe hair color of mummies or buried bodies can change. That is why Egyptian mummies have reddish hair. the melanin breaks down when oxidized\nThat's oddly similar to iron rust. Speaking of this, hair color can often determine hair thickness, like red hair being the thinnest.\nReally. Malnutrition can cause hair to get lighter , thinner and more brittle. Dark hair can turn reddish or blondish.

Do you ever work internationally? \nUnfortunately, I don't work internationally, but I have been on trains when I visited other countries. What other names do they have for a conductor?\nIn Commonwealth English they use the title "guard" or "train manager". Weird right?\nThat's so strange! Conductor sounds much cooler.

I have brown hair, but it's pretty light. So light that sometimes under the right lighting it looks blond!\nWell, brown hair certainly varies from blond to almost black: which is what mine was until I turned gray!\nIs it weird that I'm a little jealous? I mean, I don't want to go full grey yet, but I'm about to be 30 and I'm hoping for some nice salt & pepper in the beard soon.\nApparently levels of melanin can cause hair color to change.  Hopefully you will get some "unpigmented hair" in your beard!\nI'm a little bit more worried about the pigmentation on my skin. Feeling pretty pale. I need to spend some more time outside.

I love science fiction movies about extraterrestrial and alien invasion\nThey certainly seem interesting though I don't watch them often, do you have a favorite science fiction movie in particular?\n"War of the Worlds" written by H G Wells and starring Tom Cruise is a favorite!\nOh I think I've heard of it, I'm pretty sure it's famous. Around what time did that movie come out?\nNot sure? Another good one is Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1959\nThat certainly has an interesting title, it must have interesting special effects since it's so old. Do you know what the plot of War of the Worlds is?\nWar of the Worlds was about aliens invading earth and exterminating humans to take the planet\nWell that makes sense, the title certainly would imply something like that I suppose. Tom Cruise is quite an interesting actor and person, do you know much about scientology?

Red is my favorite color. It is the color of a lot of my favorite things, like strawberries.\nAwesome! Did you also know that Mars is red because of iron oxide?\nWow. I always wondered why.\nYeah! Mars is also the fourth planet from the Sun!\nIt is colder than Earth I imagine. Do you know more about Mars?\nYeah. It's just really cool how similar it is to Earth. The period and seasonal cycles are very similar to Earth's. \nI never knew that Mars had seasons. I bet it gets even colder there in winter though.\nYeah. Pretty cool in my opinion. Anyway, Mars also got it's name from the Roman god of War. \nThat makes sense. I always liked studying the planets growing up in school.
