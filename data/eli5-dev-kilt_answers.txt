The final scene involves future contracts. This simply means entering into a contract to buy something (oil, wheat, even frozen concentrated orange juice(FCOJ)) at a specified time for the current price. The person selling the future does not have to own the FCOJ at the time of sale he simply has to provide them at the agreed upon date. Futures help companies mitigate risk against the unpredictable price of FCOJ. If the price of FCOJ goes up the buyer wins the seller loses and visa versa. This price is often affected by fresh oranges. If there is a good harvest FCOJ price goes down and so on. The Dukes believed there was going to be a bad harvest. Their plan was to buy as much FCOJ as they could and basically corner the market then sell it at a much higher price due to a lack of oranges. So here is what happened. At first Winthrop and Valentine begin selling futures contracts at inflated prices caused by the Dukes (on the info from the fake report of a bad orange harvest) at approximately $1.45 per unit. When the report comes out that the orange harvest is expected to be good caused a massive selloff and the futures price plummeted to about $.22 cents. This is when Winthrop and Valentine begin buying futures instead of selling. So now they can fill the futures orders of $1.45 with oranges costing $.22 earning something like a 545% profit.
It is water vapor and ice. They are produced from the hot engine exhaust in the cold atmosphere. Water vapor from the engine exhaust mixed with unburnt particulate in the jet fuel gives the surrounding moist air something to latch onto and ice crystals form. Depending on the hight of the aircraft, they can last seconds to hours. If you have seen a running car on a brisk morning, that is a similar effect. The car is too close to the relatively warmer ground that trails do not last for more than a second.
Hardly. First, remember that babies were not left unattended. Our early ancestors (much like some hunter gatherer tribes still do to this day) carries their babies around constantly. Babies that are worn cry much less because pretty much their every need (food and comfort) are very close by. Additionally, we are a species that lives in groups. A group of humans is going to be loud in any situation, and the occasional baby cry is not going to add much to that. Living in a group was our protection already, not stealth.
Animals, at least higher functioning mammals, have some sort of concept of death, though I don't know how much it differs from what you or I understand death to be. Elderly pack animals (wolves, for example) will voluntarily leave the pack, stop eating, and find a quiet place to die, for example. Elephants that come across the bones of another elephant will stop and "feel" skulls with their trunks and even cover remains with brush.
Cannabis is a depressant drug, which means it slows down messages travelling between your brain and body. When large doses of cannabis are taken, it may also produce hallucinogenic effects. Cannabis can cause: reduced coordination, slower reaction times, slower information processing, confusion, changes in vision, hearing, and time and space perception. A person who has been using cannabis may think that they will be able to drive safely. However, the cannabis may have affected their view and experience of reality, and their judgement. Their actions and responses may be quite different to what is actually needed, but they may not be aware of how much their driving skills have been affected. Even after a small amount of cannabis you should not drive for at least 5 hours. (From:  URL_0 )
According to the excellent "We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed Along with Our Families," a book on the genocide, there had long been a divide in Rwanda between more agrarian and more trade oriented groups, which was loosely correlated to Hutu and Tutsi lineage. Colonizing forces sharpened and deepened this divide as a way to ease their control over the society, making it more explicitly ethnic. By the time colonization ended, the group identities had solidified as a basis for the political and social order. The divide continued to be used in politics and ultimately spiraled into the genocide.
It's way easier for the average person to do the math if the tax rates are stepwise rather than continuous. The average person isn't very comfortable with formulas, but can deal with subtraction and multiplication.
If you're not paying for it, YOU are the item being sold. They probably sell your data to 3rd party advertisers.
Physically speaking, being a naturally good singer means you were born with a good "instrument". Your vocal cords would be more elastic and flexible, and this would make your voice able to produce more overtones, or the right mix of overtones which sound pleasant. Overtones are basically sound waves on top of sound waves which have wavelengths that overlap on the original wave, e.g. half the wavelength, one third the wavelength, and we can tell the difference between a trumpet and a piano or a sweet and a shrill voice largely by picking up on the differences between the mixtures of overtones. Besides that, being naturally coordinated would help controlling the muscles which keep a steady pitch or vibrato or volume, being naturally gifted in pitch and tone differentiation would be important(good ear, perfect pitch), and because IMO natural abilities get a little too much credit with the general public, a natural patience, memory, intelligence, passion and persistence would all be very important when it comes to learning and practicing. Because no one comes out of the womb singing.
There probably would be similarities. Things that were swimmers would probably be sleek, for instance, due to natural selection. It's just that there would have been an entirely different evolutionary history and so different things may/would have been tried that didn't get a chance on our world.
One does not simply lay down a large fiber network. First, you have to have the money. That's not really an issue for Google. Then, you have to convince municipal governments to let you build a network, and you have to get past the incumbent ISP, who wants to keep their monopoly intact. You have to find enough subscribers, you have to find people to build the network, you have to do customer service and installation, and you have to not be hated by the public. Throwing money at those problems is ineffective.
Obamacare mandates that you buy healthcare insurance, or apply for free coverage from the government if you're poor enough or old enough to qualify. It gives subsidies based on income. Long story short, there are a lot of Americans who think that the free market is the best solution to all problems - healthcare included. They view Obamacare as evil for two reasons: 1) it forces you to purchase something against your will, and 2) it runs contrary to free market principles. Many (most?) of these people also tend believe that healthcare in the US is significantly superior to that which exists in the UK/Canada/Switzerland/etc.. Thus, any move toward a European model is viewed as a degradation of current services.
Ice, ice, baby. Much of the land on earth is covered by ice...snow pack, ice caps, glaciers, etc. They stay ice, and even grow, because it is cold enough they get more snow on them then they lose to melting. But if the temperature goes up just a little bit, some of them will melt faster than they grow, and start to shirk. That water eventually makes it to the ocean raising its level. Even worse, ice is *reflective*. When the energy from the sun hits dirt instead of ice, more of it is absorbed, and less is reflected. That causes the earth to heat even more. Finally, change the configuration of ice around the world can change weather patterns. It might not get a lot hotter where you are, but if prevailing winds change the rainfall you get, your farmland can turn to desert or swamp. Over time, even a small increase in temperature can make a big difference.
Higher quality cameras, different ratios, but mainly color correcting. Color correcting adds the overall theatric and cinematic feel o a film. It's why when you see raw footage of the movie it looks like a lower quality. There is sometimes some cg overlay as well.
Much of our perception is focused on revealing differences. Thus it is not the level of the noise but the uniformity of it. Say for example you fixed tacos for dinner. You notice the yummy smell of food as its cooking, you enjoy the aroma as you take your first bit. Then after dinner you clean up, watch a tv show and relax. Before you head upstairs to go to bed you take the trash out. You notice the air smells brisk and clean. You walk back in and the smell of mexican food nearly knocks you over. You didn't notice this before you took the trash out because it became the new normal. You mind adjusted to the mexican food smell and it became the new baseline odor. Sounds even vision are the same way. Right now your brain is rendering invisible tiny blood vessels in your eye because they don't move. You mind erases them assuming you don't care about them, allowing you to focus your attention on the things that change. Think about how noise canceling head phones work. They create a wave form opposite of the wave form entering your ear and play that back to cancel out the outside sound. Essentially they are making sounds to fill in the differences of the outside sound. You still have the same sound pressure level reaching your ear, but because its constant and causes no vibration you hear nothing (or less).
Sure. You are going forward in the future all the time. We also know exactly what to do for you to experience a second while the whole world ages through centuries. Basically the faster you move, the slower your time goes, so at certain speeds, your second will be a year for the rest of the world. Same thing happens with gravity - the more gravity the slower times goes, so clocks on the Moon go faster than clocks on Earth. You could theoretically get an orbit around a black hole, so that your time slows down enough, that when you return you'll find yourself in a far future. Both of these things are proven experimentally and most famous example are GPS satellites which were highly inaccurate before these effects were accounted for. --- Backwards time travel works too, but only in equatioms. Theoretivally if you were going faster than light it would work. The only problem is that going at the speed of light is impossible. If you were to find a wormhole (also exist only on paper), they could transport you in time as well.
Heating the window is, of course, a safety feature. As for the "warm feet", that's just blowing it at the bottom because warm air will rise, so it makes the most sense to send it out at your feet. You might look for an aftermarket accessory called "gloves".
 > So why can't there be true randomness We don't know that there cannot be, and indeed certain physical phenomena that we observe appears to be truly random, at least on an extremely small scale. So the assumption is not supported by current evidence.
The smell lingers as long as you're drunk because it's not coming from residual booze in your saliva, it's the smell of your blood itself. When you imbibe an alcoholic beverage, ethanol (the active ingredient that gets you drunk), is absorbed into your bloodstream. Ethanol is a volatile chemical (it evaporates easily), so when alcoholic blood passes through your lungs, some of the ethanol evaporates into the air that you exhale. It's this process that allows a breathalyzer to measure BAC based on your exhalation.
There's a show on A & E called "Fit to Fat to Fit." It follows personal trainers who purposefully eat junk for 8 weeks to get fat. And then they lose the weight alongside their heaviest clients. Most episodes follow similar tropes. Typically, the trainers feel great for a week or two. The rush of processed sugars in their lean bodies and relaxation of regimens is a pretty common theme. After a while, they all become sluggish and disinterested in day to day stuff they used to love. They become flabby and all of that hits them psychologically since they pride themselves on fitness and their physique. TLDR while it might be fun for a little while to go on a binder, it would take a toll on your organs, your physique and quite possibly your mental state.
Imagine you buy a car. Let's say a Chevy Cruze cuz why not. Now, Chevy has all sorts of reasons to want you to only use Chevy certified mechanics and official Chevy spare parts because they can make money from that service and maintain quality control. On the other hand, you as a consumer wants to find the best deal for repairs that you can and since you own the car, should be able to do so. Chevy says that they only provide parts to their guys and if you want a repair you're just stuck with a Chevy mechanic, sucks to be you. The right to repair is basically saying that you as the consumer should have a choice in who fixes your property.
Remember -- free as in free speech, not free as in free beer. The mission of the FSF is to promote the expansion of practices for sharing. It is about enabling the investigation and modification of software by users, and ensuring proper attribution to the writers of software. Let's say you are using the GPL license, which is their most restrictive. You (and others) still have the right under that copyright definition to sell the software in whatever format you want for profit. You (and others) can sell services for helping with the software. You can run software as a service on top of the copyleft software. You can request donations. You can seek grants. You can sell ads on the project site. There are many ways to make money that are not just the selling of software.
It may not be available to them. Full-time positions are significantly more expensive for companies, as once you cross a certain threshold of hours the benefits you need to offer your employees increases. (Exactly what depends on the state.) Thus, a company may be able to save money by juggling several part-time people to meet their needs rather than employing one full time. This often puts employees in a position they're not fans of since it'll often mean they're working the equivalent of a full time load (at multiple employers), but not getting benefits like health insurance from any company.
Finally somebody asking about this! I was beginning to think people were blind to this, since it could easily trigger a larger international crisis. My professor summarized it today, actually, and I will attempt to relay her ideas. The long and short of it: Islamic groups, some but not all associated with Al-Qaeda, want to establish a larger Islamic state in the western Sahara and instil Shariah law. However, many of the citizens, most of them Muslim, are not devout Muslims nor do they support such a drastic state. However, they also do not necessarily support the West, which still has remnants of colonial pretensions (see France having an Army base in Mali, it is a legacy of this older time). Many of them are armed since thy were originally part of Ghaddafi's army, and have now trucked all that high-level military equipment into northern Mali. Naturally, this does not sit will with the current government, Mali's neighbours, or the West (who oppose the Islamists for various reasons I do not comprehend as of yet, but alliances are part of it). Most recently, they took a key town smack in the centre of Mali, and, despite the UN resolution for intervention not taking place until almost half a year from now, France deemed that they absolutely had to begin military intervention since this town would open all of Southern Mali up to these Islamic rebels, especially since it has a usable airfield. it didn't hurt that France had a military base the next town over. At the moment, many UN nations have agreed to intervene, France and the United States being two of them. Canada has limited itself to training Nigerian troops who are fighting, since they refused to take an active combat role after the mess that was Afghanistan. This is controversial since the Islamic groups quite probably don't care, and see intervention as a yes/no thing. EDIT: as to Germany, I do not know.
The butterfly wafts some pollen off a flower. The pollen gets in a herd animal's nose, causing it to sneeze. The sneeze startles the herd, causing it to panic and stampede. The stampede raises a dust cloud. The dust cloud causes a local weather change that eventually leads to a hurricane. (I forget the steps after the dust cloud.)
Running the DirectX installer is not a matter of making sure your overall DirectX install being up-to-date. Microsoft has a helper library with D3D called D3DX. You'll find binaries for this like d3dx9_43.dll in your Windows\system32 folder. There are over 40 different versions of the D3DX library for D3D9 alone, and many more for D3D10 and 11 as well. Each game that uses the D3DX helper library is linked to a specific version. As such the game must run the correct D3D installer version that it was specifically compiled with to ensure the binaries exist. Even if a later version of the binary is already installed, that version cannot be used, and even if your DirectX install is up-to-date because you've run a more recent version of the installer that is not guaranteed to have installed all previous versions. Even worse, if a version is installed for x86 it doesn't guarantee the same version is installed for x64, so 64 bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run. Furthermore, Microsoft's licensing terms prevent anyone from distributing the files directly, the only way to distribute them is to run the installer, that's also the only supported method from Microsoft to check that the correct version installed. Trying to manually check for the correct versions is extremely complicated because there are numerous files that must all be present and individual system configuration options like dll search paths complicate the situation. In addition, the dependencies and required checks may change in each new version of the D3DX runtime. The code to check correctly and repair broken installs all exists in the installer and running it is a guarantee that the correct binaries will exist when you run the game and prevents lots of bad cases where a game would fail to launch with an obscure error if a windows install was either missing the correct version or somehow corrupted in the past.

Large dogs do consider smaller dogs prey. Your dog is just socialized well/naturally has no or low prey drive.
The Pope is the absolute monarch of Vatican City. Within city, his word is law, and he can override everyone else within the Vatican City. Outside the city, he is the final word for the Catholic Church's official doctrine. He can speak *Ex cathedra,* (from the chair), which means he IS speaking for God, and everything he says while doing so IS God's word. Unofficially, the Pope is the face of the Church and (for lack of a better term) markets it to the world at large.
I'm not sure I accept the premise. Children in cultures where spicy food is common, think nothing of it. My nephews had no problem eating hot peppers when they were very young because it was just a normal part of their diet. It's a sort of acquired taste/tolerance and it's "easier" to acquire that at the very malleable young age. If you don't acquire it when you're very young, then it's a much slower process and might not happen until you're much older.
Nah b/c what if they start to crash and need to be intubated. They will still freak out whether it hurts or not
The underlying question here is an important one: If 'Free Will' is real, then how do you (scientifically) describe the universe in such a way that it makes sense? With almost every other phenomenon we experience, we can justify it and attribute it to the natural laws around us. But not so with Free Will. And so you have to ask... "if there is no evidence for it, why do I automatically assume it must be real?" *Everything* you perceive is as a direct result of external stimuli. So even your innermost thoughts have an outward cause, and that cause is ultimately out of your control. Even something as simple as "do I eat the chocolate now, or wait until after dinner?" will be decided by a million other factors, such as subtle gene influences, the way your personality has been shaped over the years, your metabolism, the time of day, the weather, maybe some "fat joke" comments someone made about you, etc. He comes up with a very simple experiment to try and demonstrate this: * Think of *one* person you know, and concentrate on their name. Now, explain why you chose *that* specific person, rather than the dozens and dozens of other people you know. Most people want to say "Well... I just chose them!" but neuro-physiologically, we know that's not true. That memory is *manufactured* by your brain, and you are merely the recipient of it. I'm not a philosopher myself, so it's difficult for me to talk authoritatively about it. But it's an extremely interesting and compelling argument.
The hate bandwagon, as far as I can tell, started with a series of Youtube videos that combined their songs into one larger song, proving that literally all of their songs are the same. The choruses lined up, the drumming was the same in every single song, etc. This proved that they were working from a formula to make the most palatable radio music they could, and in the process, churned out terribly bland and uninteresting music that was repeated millions of times.
Not all the bacteria present in the fish are harmful to humans. Some are, but not all. Even the harmful ones aren't always bad. Our bodies are constantly killing bad cells. Any parasites or bacteria are generally put to the death quite quickly by our bodies defenses. If a fish shows any telltale signs of being unhealthy, then these fish are not used for sushi. If a fish looks real good, it's cut up and shipped to a restaurant or market. We have figured out VERY well how to tell if a fish is not healthy. We also know exactly how to make things even healthier by caring for it properly. Sushi fish is treated VERY well, and cared for as if a tiny baby. If a person does not treat the fish properly, it can get contaminated from almost anywere. If someone touches it without gloves, drops something on it, or lets it sit out too long, the bacteria could start to grow. If the bacteria is given time to sit and multiply on a tasty piece of fish, it'll start growing into a colony. One bacteria is easy to kill, but millions are much harder. Sushi is expensive because of the work that humans put into making it perfectly safe to eat. Often, not always, fish is put into a special freezer that won't harm the fish's taste but will kill the tiny parasites that are harmful for humans.
If a girl sends you nudes and you share, its a copyright issue. If you break into someones account and steal them, you have committed a federal offense.
**Like You Are 5:** You are *always* moving through Time at approximately the speed of light. When you speed up, you begin to move through time less slowly. This is why it is technically possible to time-travel (though we can only go into the future at this point). Therefore, Time is our relative experience of moving through the fourth dimension. We can alter it by going faster and faster. If you were theoretically to accelerate yourself to 99.99% the speed of light, you would experience time-travel, where a few seconds go by for you, and perhaps tens to hundreds of years go by in the 'outside' world. **Like You Are 12:** When people call time "the fourth dimension", they are being technically correct. Basically, try to imagine the following in your head. If I wanted to, using some coordinate system, find a specific moment in space and time, I could write it as so: (X,Y,Z,T) where X,Y,Z are the dimensions you are familar with (height, width, depth). It is important to note that our distinction of X,Y,Z are completely arbitrary and based solely on our perception of the world. For the sake of this next part, just imagine that moving from place to place is simply moving in some direction (let's just say X). Time is the fourth dimension, as stated above. Essentially, what makes time 'time' is the fact that at this very moment, you and I are both moving through the 'time' dimension at *the speed of light*. Now when I move in the X-axis dimension (which again is an arbitrary direction), I am taking some of my speed away from Time, and giving it to the movement in the X-axis. If you want a visual, imagine a compass in your head where the needle is pointing straight ahead. In this image, you are sitting still, but still flying through time at the speed of light in the Time direction. When you start to move in any other direction (e.g. our spacial dimensions), you start to take some of your speed away from the Time direction, and give it to the spacial direction. Visually, this would look like the needle on the compass creeping left/right away from being perfectly straight. If I am on the space station moving 5 km/s, I am moving a tiny fraction of the speed of light. In the above compass scenario, my compass needle is slightly to the left/right. Thus, I am moving more slowly through time. This is why you have probably heard of something along the lines of time-travel and astronauts. Astronauts who spend a sufficient amount of time on the space station come back to Earth having aged ever so slightly less (I am talking microseconds less here). This is, again, because they were moving in the spacial dimensions at a fraction the speed of light. Thus, in the Time direction, they moved ever so much more slowly. Our perception of time stems from this phenomenon, which now that you have reached the end, I am proud to say that you now understand the bare-bones basics of Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity.
It depends when you start calling it a programming language. At first it was all programmed using "machine code" by putting just numbers. CPU was designed to distinguish some of them as "operation codes". For example when CPU read number 123 it knew it should read 2 more bytes and then add them. This was a bit difficult for programmers to write and read, and prone to mistakes so programmers started using mnemonics and software that would then translate them into machine code. Eg instead of putting an operation code 123 you would put "ADD" word. This was then called assembly language. It was still working on CPU level, but the code was more readable and easier to write. Later people realised that some operations are used frequently and always looks the same, so they included them in the translation software / in the compiler. You would just put a certain keyword in the source code and it would be replaced by appropriate assembly code during compilation.
Well it's not 'just pumping poison into your body.' It is a variety of treatments tailored to more specifically target certain types of cells. For instance, many target cells that undergo extremely rapid division, because this is a fairly common feature of cancer cells. This does indeed damage healthy parts of the body, for instance hair follicle cells divide rapidly, and hence you get the characteristic hair loss.
Nuclear energy is basically just generating heat to create steam to turn a turbine generator
Unlikely. Mars has temperatures between -20 and -120C, gets orders of magnitude less sunshine than Earth, and there isn't even that much CO2, because although the atmosphere is mostly CO2, the surface pressure is around 0.3% that of Earth. If you're comparing partial pressures of CO2, Earth and Mars have about the same at surface level - but on Earth, it's a trace gas, whereas on Mars it's the overwhelming majority of the entire atmosphere. Now, it would probably be possible to genetically engineer some single-cell plants or algae that could live off water ice (plenty of that on Mars) and CO2 and produce oxygen, but trees? I don't think so.
Yes. In the US at least there are laws against false advertisement. However, it should be noted that there are all sorts of loopholes which can be abused. A statement must be verifiably false in order to be a problem, so vague statements like "120% more refreshing" or things of that nature aren't actually illegal.
Sleep stages. There are 5 different sleep stages; * the 'on-ramp', you know when you're at the back of a boring class / lecture and your head starts nodding, literally 'falling asleep' as it feels like you've fallen if you catch yourself. * stage 2, your brain waves start to slow down (iirc waking, your brain has a 'frequency' of ~20 cycles per second, as this slows you become more relaxed and eventually fall asleep) * stage 3, this is 'deep sleep', usually the period where people experience erratic sleep behaviour such as sleepwalking, wetting the bed etc * stage 4, now your brain is pretty much only producing delta waves, frequency of around 1-4 cycles per second... so slooooow! If you are woken from this stage, you will feel VERY groggy and disoriented * and stage 5, the stage we all know so well... REM sleep! AFAIK, it's the 15 mins of REM sleep per hour which 'refresh' you. If you don't get REM time, you will not feel like you've slept properly. This is why we feel so ughhhhhh after drinking, because alcohol interrupts this important stage. Hangover = dehydration multiplied by being horribly sleep deprived. On that note, my hangover cure? Get up, drink a pint of water, have something nourishing, then go back to sleep for a couple of hours.
Your question is very general over a myraid of cultures and societies, but, in general, people had much less than they have today, and the things they had, they relied on to stay alive or directly provide for their families. They didn't have WalMarts, Amazon, motor vehicles, and the internet, etc. You couldn't just go get another one... in a couple days or maybe even a couple months... so if you lost something to theft, for example, it was a really big deal... (not that it still isn't a big deal, but you get my point)
First, there are no meats that are 100% safe to eat raw. There is always a risk of bacterial contamination/poisoning, especially if the meat is not cleaned properly. Second, in some places, people DO eat raw chicken...and horse, for that matter. See here from Japan:  URL_0  Now, to your question. * Saltwater helps kills bacteria, making fish less susceptible to contaminants than meat from land-based animals * Sushi restaurants still take precautions. A required step involves freezing fish at temperatures of -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) for seven days, or frozen at -31 degrees Fahrenheit (-35 degrees Celsius) for 15 hours, which kills any parasites (since these thrive in warm temperatures). * Salmonella on chicken rarely enters the meat itself, but rather thrives on the skin. Chicken sashimi (toriwasa), is often braised or seared on the outside before being chilled as above both to kill lingering bacteria and improve the texture. tl;dr: people do eat those meats raw, but not much in the US Edit: after more research, I have learned that raw chicken is rarely eaten in the US not only out of custom but also because our manufacturing process leads to high salmonella contamination (compared to chicken abroad)...
firing squads and nooses are actually not all that guaranteed. If the hanging is not done right, the convict will not die instantly and will instead suffocate to death. Firing squads are similar in that you could perhaps only graze the heart/other vital organs and not kill the person.
Life has this tendency to want to do the thing that takes the least amount of energy(for the same result). It takes a lot of work to fill your lungs to capacity, and it isn't like all the air gets used by your lungs in either case.
They're supposed to vigorously defend their client, to the best of their ability. Even the worst person in the world deserves an advocate who will work to make sure they're treated fairly, no matter the circumstance. Justice is blind, after all. Of course, that doesn't mean that the lawyer will always try to *win* the case. In a lot of cases, the best defense for a client is to fight for a plea deal: in that case, the client is admitting guilt, but for a lesser crime, or in the hopes of a more lenient punishment.
Technically, we are 'constitutionally independent', but we are not a republic. Technically, we are a 'Dominion'. This means we are self-governing and can make up our own minds regarding national and international issues and how we involve ourselves. Prior to this, we basically had to do whatever the crown told us. (ie. Go to War.) It also often made Canadians second-class citizens in the eyes of the English (ie. 'from the Colonies'). Currently, our Head of State is the Queen (or Reigning Monarch), represented by a Governor-General, and his/her Lieutenant (Pronounced 'Leftenant') Governors, one for each Province/Territory. The GG's role is... nominal at best, but is maintained for the sake of show and tradition. In reality we are government by Federal Provincial and Municipal (where there are some) governments. The head of the Federal Government is the Prime Minister, who is elected from within whichever party has the most seats (not always the majority of seats, though presently, the current government is made up of a Conservative Majority). The provincial governments are similar, with both federal and provincial govts. made up of multiple parties which generally boil down to: Liberals, Conservatives, NDP (Moderates... ish), Greens, and Bloc Quebecois (think ethno-centrists whose platform is largely based on separation of Quebec and Canada). Provincial heads of government are 'Premiers'. Municipal governments are based on towns, counties or both, depending on how the province is broken down. Federal law trumps Provincial which trumps Municipal. We elect our government by party, not leader (though its often pretty clear who the leader is going to be), and seem to do it very frequently. That said, we are still a commonwealth country and enjoy certain benefits and relationships as a result. As for the broader history of Canada, its a rich tapestry woven from many different cultures, though predominantly the Scottish, English and French (see Quebecois and Acadian, for a start), as well as, obviously, many, many Native ethnicities. Much of Canada was opened up by the fur trade, and the associated industries that sprang off them. Wiki The North West Company and/or the Hudson's Bay Company (they eventually merged) - The HBC is the world's oldest corporation, and at one time basically owned the majority of Canada. Their industry essentially recruited natives to provide animal furs in exchange (often at outrageous and exploitative rates) for Western and/or manufactured goods like linen, knives, axes, tools, guns, sugar, flour, etc. Western explorers also pushed back the boundaries of the frontier by exploring Canada via waterways; travelling in the native fashion with canoes and portaging where they could not. Eventually this was fleshed out completely by the railroad, which ultimately spanned Canada East to West, and opened up additional resources, such as timber, Gold (and other minerals) and linked the two sides of Canada. Traditionally, this railroad and its many, many assets were owned by Canada Pacific Railway, which, like the HBC, is now, sadly, a shadow of its former glory, though that glory can still be seen in the hotels they erected along the way, such as Chateau Lac Louise in Alberta, the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa, and a few others I dont remember. In terms of military history, Canada has an excellent war museum, in Ottawa, which is worth visiting and sums it up nicely. In brief, Canadian warfare has (chronologically) included a variety of conflicts with the natives, the French - who had originally colonized much of Canada but were essentially kicked out by the British, especially at such battles as the Plains of Abraham and Louisbourg. Many of the French were exiled back to France (despite being multiple-generation 'Canadians'.) others were resettled, giving rise to pocket communities like the Acadians in Nova Scotia. Canadians also fought in a variety of other international wars, including in Russia during the revolution there (though IIRC they didnt do too much), the Boer War in South Africa, WW1 and WW2. In WW1 they accomplished incredible things at terrible costs; more Canadians died in WWI than WWII. For highlights, look up Vimy Ridge (an entrenched fortification held by the Germans that had held off (and slaughtered) everyone else for years, that the Canadians essentially took in a day, by using their heads), Passchendaele and many, many others. In WWII Canadians fought alongside the British from the outset, in Africa, and later in Italy, France and Holland - which they later liberated. Most Americans have heard of the Normandy landings; what most dont know is that the landings took place on five separate beachheads. The Americans took one two(Omaha and Utah) the British, with the Free French, took two (Sword and Gold), and the Canadians took the Fifth (Juno) and most heavily defended. We also burned down the White House once. **edit1 - adding more detail**
The front surface of the mirror is glass, which is only slightly reflective and mostly transparent, while the back surface of the mirror is smooth metal which is highly reflective. The glass surface and metal surface are titled with respect to each other. Usually, you are looking at the strong reflection from the metal surface. When you adjust the mirror at night, you align the mirror so that you are now looking at the weak reflection from the glass surface and not the strong reflection from the metal. You need a weaker reflection at night because you need your eyes adjusted to low-light levels to see the streets, but the headlamps of the car behind you are very bright and will destroy your visual night-adaptation if you see a strong reflection of them. Glass always reflects a little bit of the light. If you look very closely at any standard metal-glass mirror, you will see two images slightly offset: the strong reflection from the metal and the weak reflection from the front surface of the glass.
Film is better than 1080p. Not necessarily how it was shown on a television or projector, but the film itself is higher resolution than 1080p, and even 4k. This is why it can be reformatted for our current standards. Long live film.
Household electricity is AC, your car's electrical system is DC. It takes addition equipment to convert it to DC, and you lose some efficiency in the process. Also, a car battery only produces about 500 watts, which is not enough for some high power uses. Your car's electrical wiring and fuses are not designed to deliver more power than that. So it is better to have low power DC devices that use one plug, and higher power AC devices that use a different plug.
Imagine the internet as a phone system. When you make a regular call, it's easy to see who is calling who (caller ID) and what they're saying (phone taps and the like). What TOR does is splits everything up and encrypts it. So instead of calling the person you want to talk to directly, you call a designated stranger, and give him your message in code. Then he calls another person, and re-encodes your message. Then that person sends it along again, each of them decoding and encoding parts of the message, but never the whole thing at once. Eventually, the message gets to where it was intended to go, and then the reply is sent back the same way. Now imagine that this is happening at the speed of light, millions of times a second, and instead of talking you're looking at a screen. That's TOR.
Sheep are a metaphor for good men that follow God. They're cute, harmless  &  generally do what they're told but they occasionally do something stupid, get themselves into trouble  &  need help. They're safe as long as they stay under the watch of the shepard. Goats, OTOH, are obstinate, uncontrollable  &  do what they damned well feel like - even if that means eating tin cans. They reject all authority and insist on going their own way, regardless of what's good for them. This, as a counterpoint to the sheep, nicely ties into the story of how Satan rebelled against God.
Well, you can still spot a Chicago accent, or Atlanta or New Orleans...etc. However the Midwestern accent has been adopted by news, broadcast and Hollywood., so those are alike by dissemination by the entertainment industry. Used to be that Hollywood used the artificial, trained "Mid-Atlantic" accent (Hepburn, Gable, Bogart) to appear more sophisticated and blend better into the UK accent, but it was abandoned for the Midwestern accent that the next generation entertainers and newscasters such as Johnny Carson (Nebraska) and Walter Cronkite (Missouri) had.
As stated on the comment above, Intel thoroughly dominated the desktop CPU market for way too long. Why you may ask? Let's rewind back to 2011, Intel just released their 2nd gen of core i3/i5/i7 CPUs and AMD needed to respond. AMD's response to the market is their Bulldozer line of CPUs, Bulldozer failed because it was made with too much emphasis on multi-core performance and as a result, Bulldozer CPU's single core performance were horrible. Combine that with the fact that most programs at the time did not support multi-core CPUs, AMD gave way for Intel. Fast forward to 2014 and Intel knew that AMD weren't a threat anymore, as a result Intel gotten lazy at generational improvements, causing them to "milk" the CPU market for time to come. Fast forward to the present and AMD needs to respond badly, and Zen is their last ditch effort at it. Zen was made with single core performance in mind and as a result, Zen is reported to have a 52% improvement in single core performance over Bulldozer, enough to put them in place with 5th generation core i3/i5/i7 CPUs. AMD needs Zen to succeed badly, because if they fail to meet their quota, AMD may never compete in the desktop CPU market ever again. We need Zen to succeed badly, not because of AMD's sake, but for the sake of competition in the CPU market.
In 1993, to protect the desert tortoise which was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the BLM modified the terms of Bundy’s cattle grazing agreement. Bundy refused to comply with the new terms, so the BLM cancelled his permit. Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees, but continued to let his animals roam the public lands, claiming an ancestral right to the land based on his Mormon family settling there in the 19th century and his belief that federal authority doesn't apply to state land(s). As part of an effort to further protect the tortoise, Clark County (NV) purchased all of the active grazing permits in the area and closed it to grazing. Despite him no longer having a valid legal claim, the government offered Bundy compensation, for water rights and range improvements, for his previously held grazing permit. He rejected the offer and left his cattle out there. The government finally had enough and started rounding up his cattle to move them off of the closed land. Bundy claimed the government was taking away his freedom and a bunch of Tea Party nuts showed up to support him with semi-automatic weapons. The BLM, outnumbered and outgunned, told the protesters that they had to stay within certain 'First Amendment' areas to stage their protests. This further inflamed the 'right', who began comparing the situation to East Berlin. As more anti-government groups, right-wing politicians, and gun-rights activists showed up, pushing turned to shoving and one of Bundy's kids got tasered. Seeing a Ruby Ridge/Waco situation in the offing, the government backed down, halting the round-up and vowing to continue fighting Bundy in the same courts he's ignored for the past 20 years. /standoff
My understanding is that the word "repellent" is a bit of misnomer. Your body gives off various chemicals that mosquitos have evolved to sense. They see them almost as you'd see a neon "FREE CAKE" hanging somewhere. These "repellents" are designed to mask those chemical signs so that the insects don't see you as a potential target. Unfortunately, even if that neon "FREE CAKE" sign has been taken down, and the cake has been hidden away in a fridge somewhere, when you walk into the room, you might see some other cake indicators, such as paper plates, forks, napkins, and milk. Once you've gotten that much info, you might start thinking to yourself, "Hey, there might be cake here." The same happens with the bugs. The 'repellents" won't prevent them from flying near you or even landing on you, they are just meant to mask the fact you have delicious cake hidden somewhere in your veins.
They are hiring models. It is legal to base hiring of models on physical characteristics. They have already been sued over it and won. Edit: Well I didn't think my short comment would be the at the top. Hooters lost the overall case and had to settle. However, they retained the right to maintain their hiring standards on their female wait staff. They opened many other positions to males as part of the settlement.
West excluding Russia: not enough evidence. Russia's military doctrine is called 'maskirovka', and revolves around deception. It's a tactic that has been used for approximately a millennium, and is still as effective as ever. Basically the Russians deny everything, admit nothing, and play dirty; for example there is some evidence that they painted trucks white, disguising them as an aid convoy, and used them to ship ammunition and soldiers into Ukraine. Any other nation would probably admit that they have invaded another country, but Russia's MO is deception, disguise, and denial.
Speed tests are done under ideal conditions from servers with the bandwidth possible to "max out" the testing program. Most servers you connect to on the internet are not like that. They are often overworked and the bandwidth provided to them would be fine if they were serving 100 people at once, but its probably many more multiples of that. You're basically fighting other people to get the same content. You can only cram so much down the pipe then it has to contend with all the other traffic around it as well to get to you. Most ISP speedtests and speedtest applications look for the closest server to you so you can see your maximum throughput. A lot of ISP based speedtest applications...you don't even leave their network, so you don't see any internet latency or congestion. A speedtest tells you the potential of your line. In real life, you can only download as fast as the server you're connected to can send it...plus internet overhead. Its like taking a race car on an open track. With no other cars around, you can push it to the limit. But on the freeway at 5pm in bumper to bumper traffic, that race car will be lucky to see 15 mph. It doesn't matter what kind of horsepower you have under the hood-you can't run into or run over other cars to use it to its maximum potential. You know it can do 200mph, but in that case, its only going to do 15. Edit: Thanks for the gold. I didn't expect this to blow up. I've tried to reply to a few people before I go do what I need to do this morning.
I'll use hearing as an analogy, since it's closest in my mind. Imagine that every chemical in the world made its own sound. I don't mean like the difference between the musical notes A# and D, but like the difference between a flute playing A# and a blender with rocks in it. Smell is that rich and complex of an experience, compared to the simpler colors  &  brightness of vision. Like sounds, you can smell things over long distances without direct line of sight, and it's hard to completely block out, even if you pinch off the pass to the organ sensing it. Some smells drown out others, and some come through clearly no matter what (like a baby crying). Some smells are pleasant and stir emotions (particularly primal ones like hunger, lust, and safety), and some are incredibly annoying or even painful. Some differences are that you filter out background smells faster and more completely than sounds; you don't usually smell yourself at all, whereas you do hear a distorted version of your own voice always. It's harder to be overwhelmed by odors unless they come from gasses that cause other physiological effects (e.g. ammonia), whereas deafening sounds will cause permanent damage. It's hard to impossible to burn out smell from overexposure to non-toxic chemicals. On the other hand, bad smells can make it hard to breathe and make you nauseous. I can only imagine eating without smell would be like watching a movie without sound and subtitles. Maybe you can get a general feel for what people are saying by watching lips (so long as they face you), but you miss out on the effects of the background music for setting mood and all the foley effects. [Edit: Missing a word.]
Filtering ocean water to the point of it being drinkable is an INCREDIBLY expensive process. Just getting the salt out alone is very expensive. Then the water still has to go through the whole usual water cleaning process. On top of that, the solution really only helps those close enough to an ocean to get to the water. There'd be no feasible way to get the water to the center of large continents that didn't involve literally shipping it in trucks/trains/etc. Water in large volumes is incredibly heavy, thus very expensive to ship. So the question becomes how do you deal with all of that? Who pays for what? Do we have enough of the materials needed to filter that much water long term? Who's responsible for building new infrastructure? Where does the money come from? All that money being sucked into maintaining the current water supply would cripple most economies. And this is just the 1st world discussion. In 3rd worlds, where EXISTING fresh water is already hard enough to come by, there'd be no good solution at all.
They aren't necessary. They are effective at getting people to ask their doctor "Would Xyzzy make my condition better? Is it cheaper?" and a host of other questions that drive sales. Commercials on TV for any product are about driving sales.
You start with a sort-of-random number. Often something like "the number of milliseconds since January 1st 1970" is close enough to random to count, but if you want to be really random, you base it off of something like whatever random noise the computer's microphone picks up or the airflow readings around the hard drive. Then you put that number through some super messy and complicated math formula to get an even more random number. Then you can feed that number back into the same calculation to get another number. These numbers aren't truly random, but it's close enough for almost all purposes.
If you look at [spending per student]( URL_0 ), we're actually quite low, wedged between Poland and Romania.

Spillways are generally used in emergency situations when you need to reduce the water level in your reservoir FAST. The water released has huge amounts of energy, as you can see in the video. Think of all the damage that water can do when it reaches the bottom. If you just had a ramp straight down, the water would reach the downstream riverbed with huge amounts of energy, and start pushing away the soil and rocks at the bottom (causing erosion). But, so what if that stuff gets pushed away? Well the dam is a really heavy structure that's supporting lots of pressure, and so it requires a good base to stand on. If this erosion goes uncontrolled, the dam can become unsupported and lose stability, leading to a collapse. This would be catastrophic for anyone/anything that is downstream. (You can google dam collapses, that shit ain't pretty). With this in mind, spillways are designed with a big curve at the bottom called a 'ski jump'. The purpose is simple: to dissipate all of that energy flowing downstream. And tbh it also has the added benefit of looking super cool.
I assume ELI5 actually means explaining like OP is 5. So I'll give it a shot. When someone says *passed down*, they typically mean transferring a trait from parent to child. There are 2 ways this can happen. **Environmental factors** (these are things that are *outside* the body. Like home-life, parent-child relationship, type of friends, role models, all that good stuff)  &  **Genetic factors** (things that are *inside* the body. Like genes and...well mostly just genes) The potential environmental factors are obvious, so I'll spare reddit the details. Genetic factors are a little more complex. You see, the mechanism of **addiction** is in the brain. But not just in a person's thoughts and/or feelings, but *literally* in the brain. In the pink tissue inside our skulls, there are tiny receptors (think of a baseball glove) that *catch* tiny neurotransmitters which are chemicals created and released *by* and *to* other brain tissue (think of tiny baseballs). Now, drinking alcohol, for most, makes a person feel good, right? When the brain feels good like this, it releases baseballs to their respective baseball gloves. However, overdoing this will cause the brain to create more baseballs than gloves. But the brain is basically a god-damned 3d printer. So it just creates more baseball gloves for the extra baseballs. Here's where the plot twist comes in, and where alcoholism rears it's head. These gloves don't *just* catch baseballs. They catch all kinds of balls as well, such as tennis balls (seizures), golf balls (hallucinations), and ping balls (death). An alcoholic, then, has to KEEP drinking alcohol to make the brain continue to release enough **base**balls to fill up the available gloves and to prevent these random other balls from entering the gloves. These gloves have always been able to catch these random balls, but since there was always a limited number of gloves, the chances of catching a tennis ball in the middle of a baseball field was always highly unlikely. So addiction comes down to too many gloves catching the wrong balls. Now, the most common way this happens is by the pathway mentioned above: a person drinking way too much and then causing the brain to make shitload a gloves. However, genetics has a role here too. There are some folks who's brain's 3d printer is way too efficient and is programmed to build more gloves quicker. In other words, in these folks it would take less drinks to cause them to become full blown alcoholics. Also, genetics can affect how *good* a glove can catch these other balls. So if you're brain's 3d printer is building Hyuuuge gloves, then obviously that person's glove will catch more random balls. Genetics can affect any part of that terrible baseball metaphor. I'd go on, but I'm sure you're getting the point. I think we've talked about balls enough today. **Serious Note**: So, no. It's not a sorry excuse for some people. It's a real disease. Hey, from personal experience, I know how problematic dealing with alcoholics can be, but they deserve empathy and patience. Some of them were just dealt a bad hand.
One possible explanation: mixers. Lots of people shoot tequila straight, whereas rum is commonly taken in tandem with something else – cola, for example. If you're combining gin with tonic, or vodka with something super-caffeinated like Red Bull, whose to say the drunk you're experiencing is due to the alcohol, and not because of what you're drinking with it? Despite the fact that there are no scientific studies (to my knowledge) that examine the behavioral effects that different alcoholic beverages may or may not have, the most common explanation for the differential effects of booze is that it's all in your head, and that your experience with a given alcohol is dictated largely by the social situations in which you choose to consume it. Fundamentally, alcohol is alcohol whichever way you slice it.
Legally, no. They could not use the leaked/stolen code in their own OS, because it is leaked/stolen. Microsoft still owns the rights to it. The same way they can't take a windows machine and reverse engineer the code from it (legally) Illegally, they could try, but Microsoft would have them so tied up in lawsuits it wouldn't be worth the effort However, there are already programs out there to allow Windows programs to run on other OSes, such as WINE.
A karat in terms of gold is not the same measure as a carat of diamond weight. A carat of diamond weight is equivalent to 0.2g. Many other stones are also measured in carats, but due to varying densities, a carat of sapphire is physically smaller than a carat of diamond. Karat in gold terms is a measure of purity. Because it is measured as 24 times the purity by mass, 24k gold is pure (well, 99.9% pure) gold. 18k gold is 75% pure gold. 12k gold is 50%, and so on. The markings on the inside of a piece of jewelery may indicate the purity of the material. 24k is marked 999. 10k is marked 417. (99.9% and 41.7% respectively.)
Normally, this refers to peer-reviewed articles published in academic journals, like [this]( URL_4 ) or [this]( URL_1 ) or [this]( URL_2 ) or even [this]( URL_3 ). Literally tens of thousands if not more of these journals exist, covering about every field you can imagine and then some. Some that are very prominent include *Science*, *Nature*, *Journal of the American Psychological Association*, *Journal of the American Medical Association*, etc. These very high-profile journals often cover a broader field, whereas smaller, lesser-known journals (like the reindeer one above!) usually publish articles on very specific subfields. These are published by private academic publishing companies like [Elsevier]( URL_0 ), or by professional/academic organizations like the American Medical Association, or university-owned companies like the [Cambridge University Press]( URL_5 ). People who read them include other researchers in the field, who usually have subscriptions through their institution. You do that because you want to stay up-to-date on what's happening in your field! "Articles" can be many things, but generally think about anything you might write in college/university for a class, but more detailed and on a more advanced topic. In science, most commonly they can be the results of an experiment or experiments on a single topic (kind of like a lab report), but they can also be a review of current research in a field, responses to other studies that have been published, case studies of a single patient in medicine, etc. In other fields, they take many forms...book reviews, essays on a particular philosopher, you name it. "Peer-reviewed" means that when you submit an article, it gets reviewed by an anonymous panel of reviewers people who are selected by the journal *who know a lot about that field*, usually other professors/researchers. This is key, because it means what you wrote has to stand up to the scrutiny of people who also know a lot about the subject. If I submit an article to a physics journal about how we're all quantum wavelengths of the divine or something, the physicists who review it will say "nope, this doesn't make sense." Whether it's a valid metric is a controversial question. Certainly someone who has published tons of work in important journals has likely done a lot of important research, and also importantly lots of people have heard of their research. However, you can probably imagine a lot of reasons why "number of published papers" does not = "great researcher!"

Birthmarks are caused by some body tissues, such as blood vessels, smooth muscle, and fat when they grow too much. It is not well understood why this happens, but one of the leading ideas is that there is an imbalance in the different factors relating to skin cell growth and migration.
Imagine I gave you a whole bunch of blocks, and asked you to arrange them for me. I need you to arrange them in a rectangle. Let's start with 10 blocks: ********** After messing around a bit, you manage to make the following rectangle: ***** ***** Good! Now count the number of blocks on each edge of the rectangle. 2, 5, 2, 5. Notice each number will for sure appear twice, so we only need to keep track of the two that might be different, 2 and 5. We call these numbers a *factorization* of our first number, 10. What if I give you one more block? ***** ****** It doesn't seem to fit anywhere. After a while, you give up. That's because 11 is a *prime* number, the only rectangle you can make with it is: *********** the line rectangle. Now, how about we add one more? ************ This time, you manage to make two *different* rectangles: ****** **** ****** **** **** So 12 is definitely not prime, it is composite. Why don't you try 13? What makes primes important is that you can use them to build up all the other numbers. When you have a composite number, you get two factors, two numbers that multiply to give you the composite number. These two numbers might be prime, but if not, you can factor them instead, and keep going down until you have all prime numbers. For example 10=2\*5, which are both prime. 12= 2\*2\*3, all prime. So often, if mathematicians can show something is true for prime numbers, they can then show that it is true for all numbers, because every number is built up this way from prime numbers.
Well you've got it pretty much. The most widespread interpretation is that the first part of the story (Betty) is a dream, dreamed by Diane. The second part is real but full of flashbacks, so it can be confusing. Basically, in chronological order: Diane comes to Hollywood hoping to become a famous actress. She meets Camilla and falls in love with her. The truth is that she's a failed star as you said, and Camilla is actually toying with her. So she hires a hitman to kill Camilla. She then dreams the perfect life for her and Camilla (as Betty and Rita) which is the whole first hour or so of the movie. Then she wakes up, full of guilt and regret, and kills herself when confronted with her inner demons. The movie makes much more sense if you watch it knowing this. Through the story of Diane, it's a piece about the Hollywood life and how it corrupted and destroyed a naïve young woman.
In Islam, portraits and photos of their figures is forbidden. Check out a mosque sometime. . No photos but lots of geometrical art and Arabic calligraphy.
The stroma (top layer of the iris) is what determines eye color. For those with no melanin (pigment that makes eyes or skin a warm brown), the only color comes from the Tyndall effect of light scattering in the iris. This creates a blue color, like water with glacial flour or dirty smoke. When the stroma has a little melanin, it looks green because this blue combines with the the orangey brownish melanin. When it has a lot of melanin, the brown color takes over completely.
Normal shoes will adapt to your feet after a while. Ski boots shouldn't adapt, they should brace your foot. You can get the inner shoe shaped to fit your foot. it costs like $300-500. But a far cheaper thing that people don't know about is that you can take your boot to a (good) ski shop and they can stretch your off-the-shelf boot where it hurts your foot. About half an inch or so. It's usually like $30-80. It works out great for many people. Edit: but they ski boots are not as bad as they used to be, right?

You are I are plumbers. We each bill 300K worth of plumbing work each year. We each spend 50K on materials each year. We each have 100K of business expenses each year. You are incorporated, I am not. How much tax should each of us pay? The same. Since I am not incorporated I take the 150K I made in profit and pay tax on it like income at my personal rate. Lets say I end up paying 50K in tax. Since you are incorporated you pay corporate tax on the 150K, and then distribute the remainder to yourself as a shareholder. That's dividend income and as a person you are going to pay tax on it. The government plays with the personal dividend rate, and the corporate tax rate with the (rough) idea that it should add up to the same as the personal tax rate for regular income. That's why, primarily, corporate tax rates are different from personal tax rates - the government knows the money is going to be taxed again when passed on to shareholders.
I believe what you're referring to the "transatlantic accent" which was taught in boarding schools up through the early 60's (also many actors and the like learned the accent to be more marketable, as it was seen as an upper-class/well-educated way of speaking).
It's not Hershey's blocking Cadbury's. It's Cadbury's blocking Cadbury's because they've sold the rights to Hershey. Cadbury's signed a contract with Hershey's stating that Hershey's would manufacture chocolate in the US and sell it in the US under the Cadbury's name. Hersheys paid Cadbury's a sum of money for this privilege. In return Hershey's gets to use the Cadbury's name and advertizing. In addition Cadbury's agrees not to sell it's own chocolate within the United States. The problem here is that people are importing Cadbury's from the UK and selling it in the US. If Cadbury's does not take steps to prevent this then Hershey's could sue them for breaching the contract mentioned above. Since Cadbury's actually likes that contract (because of all the money Hershey's pays them) then don't like these chocolate importers. So they attempt to block it. It's not Hershey's doing the blocking. It's Cadbury honoring the commitment they made when they signed that contract.
Eye color comes from the amount of a specific pigment/dye in your iris called *melanin*. Melanin is a brown pigment found in many places throughout your body, including your hair and skin. The more melanin in your skin, the darker it is. With a few exceptions (I'll get to them later), every eye color comes from a different level of melanin in the topmost layer of the iris. The more melanin, the darker and browner the eye. The less melanin, the lighter and bluer the eye. Green eyes are just blue with a slight tinge of brown. Hazel eyes are a moderate amount of brown. The reason that no melanin = blue is the same reason the sky is blue. It's an optical effect called [Rayleigh scattering]( URL_0 ). The light waves get mixed up and "scattered" by the tiny transparent molecules of the top layer of the iris. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, making the whole area appear blue. There isn't actually any blue pigment in the eye (or in the sky); it's all an optical illusion. There are eye colors that are outside this blue < - > brown spectrum, though. These are amber (gold-ish), gray, and violet. Amber eyes come from a different pigment called lipochrome. Gray eyes are "cloudy" blue eyes. The molecules in the iris have banded together into larger "clumps". The optical effect of this is the same as water molecules clumping together into water droplets and forming a cloud, creating a gray sky. Violet eyes occur only in albinos. There is so little pigment in the iris (not just the topmost layer is pigment-less, but the lower layers as well) that light can actually shine through from inside the eye. This gives you an eerie highlight of the blood vessels running through it, which can appear red or violet depending on the lighting conditions.
The problem is that there are very many downsides to routine checks. Too many downsides, in fact. First of all, we do not have the resources to preform routine checks on everybody. In many places, there are already long waiting lists when people need certain types of scans or care. If we tie up our limited amount of scanning equipment and personnel that can use these machines and interpret the results with millions of people who don't even need them, the waiting lists will only get longer and longer. Secondly, body scans are not magic. They can detect if there are irregularities in your body. They cannot immediately detect whether this irregularity is something to be concerned about or not. Most of us have irregularities in our bodies that are absolutely nothing to worry about, just a result of how we aren't perfect beings and don't grow perfectly. If everybody gets routinely scanned, all of these irregularities are going to pop up and doctors will pretty much be obligated to investigate them further. Even though 99% of them are absolutely not any danger to you. That means more tests (so again, more strain on our limited resources) and also means more stress Which brings me to point three: quality of life. Basically, routine scans do not improve quality of life. In rare rare rare rare exceedingly rare cases, they might detect something slightly earlier than it would otherwise have been detected. In most cases it is going to detect harmless irregularities, which will lead to people having to undergo more (and sometimes painful testing), which they will have to wait longer for due to the longer wait lists, which all accumulates in a huge increase in stress. All to tell you something they knew already, namely that there is nothing wrong with you. Basically, the very marginal benefits of a system like this do not outweigh the much more common adverse effects (all the extra stress and pain of tests that people will experience and the added wait time to everybody else who *does* need these tests and might be in a worst position due to the long wait), so we don't do it.
A lot of answers are saying "menthol cools", but that's wrong. Menthol produces the *sensation* of cooling without *actually* cooling, by activating the nerve receptors that would normally react to cold temperatures.
This does not really change things for humans. We already knew there was water on Mars, we just weren't sure of any liquid water. The surface is still generally too cold, and too low pressure, for a human to survive. You'd need an enclosed environment, and if you had one of those you could just melt water ice from the planet.
this always gets asked and no one has a concrete answer. I heard on a documentary that its actually your balls/ovaries tucking into your body to protect themselves presumably from physical trauma. But I cant find anything on the internet to validate. Its a quick physical movement that causes the feel. Similar to falling when the balls or ovaries are actually moving. If you are in free fall long enough like in a space shuttle your body stops because they cant go tucking in any further or your body realizes they no longer need protecting. TL;DR your balls protecting themselves by tucking into your body
Because that was good enough for audiences of the day. Most people have little exposure to real fighting, and up until the 60's, the only martial art they were likely to have seen was boxing. Movies followed these expectations, and most fights were stand up punching. With the rise of the Hong Kong movie industry, and martial arts stars like Bruce Lee, audience expectations changed. Stand up punching seemed slow and ponderous, so it was necessary to mix in some more sophisticated fighting. Also, the way audiences viewed their movie heros changed. You used to have John Wayne cowboy type leads, who were better than everyone else by virtue of being special. He won his fight because he was always stronger, tougher, and luckier than mere supporting roles, that all the reason the audience needed. Today's heroes are usually a little more nuanced. If they are going to win a fight against a bigger, stronger opponent, the movie has to show how he outsmarts or outskills the big lug.
Some of it is a subconscious desire to avoid morning responsibility. For me it is a desire to just do things that I would not otherwise have time for during the day. Like surfing the web, or playing games, or reading stuff on Reddit are all things I like to stay up late doing, even though I know my body is going to wake up early in the morning. The mental stimuli keeps me going, and because I am deriving enjoyment and excitement out of it and therefore I keep myself up later because of that and in-spite of the fact that I know I should go to bed earlier.
Pretty much everyone got together and agreed to A. Stop building nukes B. Get rid of the nukes they have (this has been progressing slowly) C. Share nuclear technology for energy purposes. The big countries benefit from number 1- no new nukes, so the balance of power swings more towards them. Less powerful countries like 3- they get free technology and don't have to rediscover nuclear power on their own if they want to have their own reactors. Not everyone signed the treaty- in particular, India, Pakistan, and Isreal. The first 2 have publicly shown that they have developed nukes, and everyone is pretty sure about Israel. Iran *did* sign, which is why the UN is allowed to care about their nuclear program.
When you add a character to a password, the number of possible permutations goes up exponentially. Lets assume we have a simple password requirement - only upper case letters. Below are the number of possible passwords based on character count - 1 character - 26^1 - 26 combinations - 2 characters - 26^2 - 676 combinations - 3 characters - 26^3 - 17,576 combinations - 4 characters - 26^4 - 456,976 combinations - 5 characters - 26^5 - 11,881,376 combinations - 6 characters - 26^6 - 308,915,776 combinations - 7 characters - 26^7 - 8,031,810,176 combinations - 8 characters - 26^8 - 208,827,064,576 combinations So, even in our simple system, an 8 character password has over 200 billion possible combinations. ~~This is getting beyond a computer's ability to brute force (just keep trying combinations until it gets it right) ability.~~ While this is still within the average computer's ability to crack, you can see how even in our simple system, more characters becomes more difficult *Edit: Look, I am not suggesting that an eight-character, upper case letters only password is a good idea or even used by most systems. I was just creating an easy to understand, ELI5 example of entropy.
When people talk about "perpetual motion machines" they don't mean the literal "moving forever" they mean a system that runs forever but you can keep extracting energy from, or generates more energy than was put in without any other loss. a rock could orbit another rock and both could hurtle through a vacuum forever. No work is being done no energy is being taken from the system. So it's happy to just keep moving forever. but if you want to make those rocks do some work or touch them in any way they will stop moving or slow down. same with an Atom, while there might be "movement" of sorts inside that motion does not perpetually generate energy.
The big reason is that it's near a fault line. No matter how safe you make it, it's hard to tell how much damage an earthquake could actually do. And despite how good it is, there's still a very negative perception of it just because of the word nuclear. Too many people seem to think that it's akin to a nuclear weapon when they're not really similar at all.
If they went rouge and killed everyone we'd just stop resupplying it

Here was my experience: Every time my songs were played on the radio or on TV somewhere, I got a little bit of money - cents to dollars - depending on the use. One song was played enough times that it put me in a higher royalty bracket so I was paid more (1.5x the normal rate, I believe) per use. If played enough times, that money can really add up even if you're paid at the normal rate. I had a (brief) Top 40 Rock song in the mid 90s. To date, I've probably made $10,000 in performance royalties from it. Checks would come quarterly. At its peak, these checks used to be in the high hundreds to low thousands. These days, they're about 75 cents, if there's a check to cut in the first place. :-) EDIT: Reddit, you amaze me. Thanks for the love. EDIT#2: [Removed questionable link] Sorry! EDIT #3: Dammit Reddit! Thanks for the gold, kind Redditor. :-) EDIT#4: Thanks so much for all of this. Seriously. But my wife will kill me if I keep responding so I have to step away.

It was once popular to create rhyming nicknames. So Richard becomes Rick, which then becomes Dick. This is the same reason that William becomes Bill.
The short answer is that he had a knack for biotech stocks. He self-taught himself biology and chemistry and was able to comprehend complicated papers and study results that most people in finance cannot understand without the help of expensive industry consultants. This can be very helpful in taking short position against stocks of drug companies that have failing products, which so many in biotech do. Very few drugs in development ultimately get FDA's approval. It can also help you assess what company is undervalued based on its drug portfolio. His knowledge, apparently, also allowed him to convince a lot of people to invest in his firms. Because they believed he really knew what he was talking about. It turns out that a lot of his investments, especially those made at his hedge funds, were simply too risky. He may have been cocky about his expertise and underestimated how much the biotech sector was influenced by other factors outside his control.
I actually know quite a bit about this. My best friend writes the code for the optics that go into machines lime this and a ATM's. Basically what happens is the US bills have water marks and other identifying features on them for safety. When you use a specific light they light up brightly. A photosensor is able to identify the image and thus the bill it is. A 1 has no mark. A 5 I think has Lincoln on it, a 10 is Hamilton and so on. So the computer matches it up with a portrait like a game of guess who and then identifies the bill that way. This is only one way. Some higher tech machines have more sophisticated means. Some include identifying the specific ink that's on the bill, identifying micro print and so on. It'll depend on the level of security required by the customer as to which programs get put where. For instance vending machines the risk of loss is relatively small. So a less advanced identifying algorithm is used. An ATM involves a high level of risk so an advanced algorithm would be used. So on and so forth. Edited ATM
I'm not even trying to be funny, I would just honestly love to see someone try to explain that shit. Good luck to whoever takes this on.
The issue is not actually the temperatures we are going to be changing to. It is the speed of the change. We have taken a warming process that would have taken up to 100,000 years or more and sped it up. Even if we have only made it 10 times faster some animals that could have adapted in 100,000 will not be able to adapt in 10,000. And odds are that the speed we have increased the change is far far faster so the chances of animals adapting is far lower. But with polar bears there does seem to be one kind of adaptation occurring. They are mating with Grizzly and Brown bear and having hybrids that are fertile.
When you say "people" you mean "reddit". And "reddit" isn't a qualified/peer reviewed institution claiming to be a source of factual information. The generally accepted sources of "factual" information are journals which usually are collections of independently (or sponsored) publications which have been extensively peer reviewed. This basically means that anything that's published is reviewed by qualified professionals to ensure that what is submitted isn't just a bunch of gobbledegook - which happens quite often.
Most of the high end sports cars put the engine behind the driver, but ahead of the rear axle for better weight distribution. These are considered mid-engined cars. A car with 50/50 weight distribution front to back will be more stable, easier to control and faster through curves.
There are a number of stereotypes about sexuality in women in modern society, and many of them are problematic. The major one when it comes to rape, is that a woman’s value lies in her genitals, and that sex is an object or ‘treat’, that a woman can ‘give’ or ‘grant access to’. To say it as simply as possible (minding that it is more complex than this), if someone believes that they are ‘owed’ sex (whether it be because they have been dating someone for a while, because they are married, or even just because they were being flirted with), and they are sufficiently violent, frustrated or mentally unstable, they may try to ‘take’ the sex that was ‘owed to them’. The ‘empowerment’ idea comes from reinforcing the idea to women (and men) that women are not objects, or gate keepers to sex, but muti-dimensional **people**. Who have choice. And the choice to say no is one that they are entitled to. (Subnote: Not all rape occurs in a dark alleyway with a stranger. A lot of the time, it is someone known, or dating; where the woman is either too afraid/feels unable to say ‘no’, or the man does not listen to that ‘no’.)
Legally, they can show it, however unofficially, it is banned based off previous agreements and codes of conduct and network guidelines. What does that all mean? It means while the govt hasn't specifically prohibited commercials from showing alcohol consumption, among advertisers and tv stations/channels its an official (but not legally binding) agreement that they simply do not show people drinking alcohol in a commercial, if you want your commercial to air. There is not much demand to change this, so it goes on.
After a degree in neuroscience, I've come to realize that there are multiple kinds of thought and they all arrive into perception in different ways. There are forms of thought that do not require language (such as "I'm hungry", "fire is hot", "flowers are pretty and smell nice", "find protection from danger", etc.) and forms that do (such as "Reddit is a good forum to get answers", "this commenter is a dumbface", "I'm beating a dead horse", etc.). **Simply put: language affords us a method to track the progression of a thought and follow it's logic to a meaningful conclusion.** Without language, our conclusions would be a lot simpler and less meaningful.

Because even though it's taking stuff away, it's still a big change in what's going on around us. Us humans are wired since we were primitive animals to react to things that might indicate danger. When a big noise suddenly happens, we'd wake up in case we had to flee. When a long consistent noise and light that had been going on for some time suddenly stops, same thing happens, and alarm bells go off so we bolt awake. [Here's a prank where you can see what happens when something in the environment stops. It's pretty jarring.]( URL_0 )
Planned-obsolescence is largely a myth. I'm an engineer, and sure, we often design things to some minimum spec. It *could* be tougher, stronger, and last longer. For example, you *could* design a bridge to last over a hundred years. But a lot of bridges are torn down to widen roads, increase clearance, add a rail system, or other feature. And it's generally stupid to plan that far in the future. So, a typical bridge is designed to last 30 years. Anything longer is a bonus, and is desirable. And if you can spend an extra 10% and get several more years out of it, you might get approval to spend the money. But generally, you plan for a minimum, and don't waste money making it stronger than it needs to be. In devices, this means that a phone might be designed to last 2 years. Anything more is a bonus, and sometimes they *do* make them more future-proof. And it does make those phones more costly. But companies **do not** want to be known for having phones that die in 2 years. It reduces their brand value, and makes their customers angry. They don't do that on purpose, because it's bad for business, and people would stop buying their crappy phones. What actually happens is other tech passing up the hardware. Advances to Android/iOS, advances in cellphone radio technology, new software interfaces, increased bandwidth, higher resolutions, and other factors *besides* the phone.
Because it isn't "free". It comes out of the pockets of taxpayers anyway. The basic argument is that the government pretty much sucks at running anything. They can't even handle "free" healthcare to veterans- who make up a tiny part of the population. The "right-wing" standpoint is that the job of the government isn't to provide for the people. It's to safeguard people's rights to provide for themselves.
Practically speaking, it is because he was previously getting health benefits through his wife's job. His wife is going on an unpaid leave of absence for the duration of the presidential campaign, so he (and his wife) won't be covered. Politically, he's still against it, but said something to the effect of that its still technically the law, and he'll follow the law, even if it's one he fundamentally disagrees with.
Water boarding is a simulation of drowning, while dunking *is* drowning. ***I don't recommend it***, but if you really want you can water board yourself pretty easily. I've done it and only lasted about half a second before I almost had a panic attack. While in the shower, wet a wash cloth. Place it over your face, including your nose and mouth, and look up into the shower head and breathe in.
When saliva is allowed to sit in the mouth for a long period of time without being replaced, and then mostly dries up, bacteria can propagate better which causes the smell.
The US has many many regulations on cars, stuff like emissions controls and safety. Some of this can be extremely expensive to engineer and build, and on low-production models it's not practical. The bigger problem is the testing requirements: manufacturers are required to crash test cars and it's an extremely expensive process. And if they change something, like the transmission, they may have to re-do all the crash testing. Imported cars are required to meet many of these requirements, even if you are just trying to get one car through customs.
I have heard that it is considered respectful to wear a surgical mask in public when you are sick to limit spreading your illness in very dense cities.
I would like to point out that this dissonance we all feel when hearing our recorded voices is not just a physical difference, but a percieved difference. When we hear our voices recorded, our brain has a certain expectation of what we will hear. Having become so accustomed to what our voice sounds like in our heads, hearing something we don't expect makes our brains mad. To a unbiased third party, it may very well be that the recorded voice is more desirable then the sound oof that voice through body matter. We don't hate our recorded voices because they are better or worse, we hate them because they are challenging something we have known our whole life as a truth.
Mostly because the American one was about a part of a nation becoming independent with a new rulership and associated laws. The French one was about getting rid of monarchies, which changed power structures all over Europe, which, even Eurocentricism aside was a huge factor of influence on how the world is today. You can still see monarchies in place in countries where the revolution did not happen, so it also doesn't count as a "would have happened anyway" thing.
Neither, but I guess it would be closer to an invention in which there are discoveries. In reality it's a language. A language with a lot of rules and limitations, but discoveries about the language let us describe new things in new ways.
Because kids are self-centric. We think of our parents as OUR parents, not people in their own right.
To many creatures people are just a walking meat pile. The only reason we don't get eaten is because we walk too fast (and our internal defense system kills anything we can't walk away from). After death our bodies get eaten by bacteria, fungi, insects, small animals and whatnot. Our atoms eventually become atoms of animals and plants and earth and wind.

The sun orbits around the Milky Way center (where there is most likely a supermassive black hole of all the other stuff that fell in). The Milky Way orbits around…something. As it stands right now, it's going towards the Great Attractor, which is…something. Big. (It's really unfortunate that the way we are aligned with the Milky Way disk that it blocks our view of that…something.) The Great Attractor probably orbits around something else, but it's so far away that we'll never know for sure because it'd take too long to make one orbit. And maybe that orbits around something else. And so on. The Universe as a whole cannot orbit anything, because orbiting is moving around something *in space*, so by definition it can't orbit. Unless you subscribe to a multiverse model, but that's mostly unproven.
It comes down to being able to group that parallel data at very high speeds. Say I'm tossing a ball to you and think of this as a serial bus. Now take seven of your friends and I will get seven of mine and we will all toss the ball back and forth at the same time and that is the parallel bus. Now start increasing the speed of the ball toss back and forth. It becomes difficult to keep all eight pairs transferring the ball at the same time. It is much easier to find one pair that kind transfer the ball very quickly than multiple pairs that can do it without one of the pair getting ahead or behind the others.

Consumed liquid doesn't immediately find its way to the bladder. First, it sits around in the stomach until the stomach contents are sufficiently digested, where the mixture is passed to the intestines. Most of the water is absorbed into the blood stream in the large intestine. Once in the blood, the excess water is removed by the kidneys and then passed down to the bladder. All of these processes take time, and the bladder gradually fills until you feel the urge to urinate.
In the US, "hate groups" are legal. You can espouse hate all you want, because you have freedom of speech. You just can't threaten people, or attempt to incite others to violence.
I believe it is their attraction to scents based with two choices, either rose water or lilac. These smells seem to be targeted or coveted to an older audience. Not sure which. My granma liked rose based. Ugh.

Hypnosis is largely misunderstood by a lot (perhaps even most) people. Even by the experts it is not fully understood. It involves taking a subject and working with them to open their mind to be more willing to accept and act on suggestions. I cannot speak to the psychology or physiology of that interaction--I'm not a doctor. However, I can say, from having listened to a number of stage hypnotists, that it is an entirely voluntary act. Hypnosis is not about the hypnotist taking control of a weak mind. It's about the hypnotist guiding a person to bring their mind to a very specific state. Thus, according to some hypnotists, it is actually *easier* to hypnotize "smart" people (I will leave the defining of "smart" as an exercise for the reader; most likely the key characteristic is that the individual has a good awareness, an ability to follow instructions, and an ability to "let go."). It's also important to remember that a person under hypnosis still has quite a lot of voluntary control. They cannot be made to go against their moral fiber or to ignore most basic instincts ("you can't hypnotize someone to death"). Also (for fans of the movie Office Space) if someone is put into hypnosis and then the hypnotist leaves then they will come out of hypnosis relatively quickly (as in within hours, as opposed to being in a semi-trance for the rest of their life). Hypnotic triggers can be activated decades later, though (in some cases).
This seems like a very valid point, but psychologists study the same thing for a very long time, doing research and attempting to refine a singular truth about aspects of society and the psyche. Because they're always doing this our understanding gets updated and refined anyway, incorporating the changes we undergo as a culture. But variations of these old experiments could only help the process, so I think yes.
They never aimed for speed on USB1. It was a replacement for a bunch of different disjoint ports with a speed that would allow all their functions to be condensed to a single connector. That was the whole point - a Universal Serial Bus. You could connect keyboards (no more PS/2 keyboard connector), mice (no PS/2 mouse connector), serial devices (no more serial ports), parallel devices (no more parallel port) and similar devices. It wasn't intended for fast transfer - you'd use Firewire/iLink/IEEE1394 for that. For a five-year-old: It's like somebody took the good Lego, Duplo, Meccano and K'Nex parts and made them fit together. Your parents will still call it a toy but it's really really awesome.

Seán comes from the Irish name for John, the accent on the a (called a fada) makes the a longer and so changes the pronunciation as well as this Se in Irish is often pronounces as SH. The name Shawn in an anglicised version of the Irish name Seán.
Most cars are FWD for two somewhat related reasons; packaging and cost. Generally speaking, FWD powertrains are less complex, require fewer parts, and take up less room than a RWD car; this makes the car lighter, cheaper to produce, and increases cabin space. Motorcycles and bikes are RWD mostly due to the interference with the steering and/or engineering difficulties that would result from running a chain to the front wheel. It's much easier to run the chain to the rear wheel that never turns.
I watched [this]( URL_0 ) documentary a couple of years ago - 'Why Aren't Thin People Fat?' It basically suggested that thin people don't eat as much as they think they do, in terms of portion size, calories, etc. They made the participants eat 4000 calories a day (I think) which most of the thin people couldn't even manage, and they all put on weight just as expected. Or all except one guy who was an anomaly, and it turned out he'd started twitching his legs and stuff to counteract the extra calories, or something. Pretty interesting stuff. Obviously there are so many other factors and theories about it; genetics, metabolism, lifestyle, etc. But basically, thin people can't actually 'eat everything' and not get fat, they just tend to have different perceptions of how much they eat.
HR is supposed to be pro-company. The entire purpose of HR is to hire and retain the employees that will bring the most value for the company. If you are looking for some group whose primary focus is the benefit of the employees, and not the company, the organization you're thinking of is called a union.

Have you considered why you believe that the Holocaust happened? Think about it. You believe that it happened because people you trust told you it did. You believe that there is a huge amount of evidence because those same people that you trust told you that there is. Have you examined the evidence yourself? Have you examined huge numbers of written accounts, and analyzed their accuracy? Have you visited the camps, spent years studying forensics, and collected the evidence you need to make a conclusion? Have you even gained enough knowledge to critically examine the work of the people who *do* claim to have done these things? Have you actually looked through the body of "videos and photos" and considered whether they constitute real evidence for the claims involved? Have you looked at Nazi records discussing mass extermination? I suspect that 99% of the people on this subreddit have not done all this. I certainly haven't. Now, I tend to trust the historians who have actually studied World War II. They put in the time, and they say it happened, so I accept that it happened. But I can't pretend that I did the work to gain that knowledge myself - someone else did that, and my acceptance of the Holocaust as a fact depends on my trust of those people. So if you don't trust the establishment, whether that be the government, or historians, or the mainstream media, then it's very easy to doubt the work that they have done, since almost nobody has actually examined the evidence themselves. This holds true for almost all historical events. If I don't trust the US government to tell the truth for shit, then why should I believe that the first moon landing was anything other than a propaganda piece? All the evidence that says it happened is sourced from somebody I don't trust, and I'm sure as hell not going to go the moon myself to check. This is why people disbelieve historical events - they don't trust the people who are the sole providers of evidence, and they are not able to put in the years of work to actually accumulate the evidence themselves.
It's not. Most of these stupid english rules (passive is incorrect, don't split infinitives, don't end sentences in prepositions, etc) came from grammar books published in the 18th and 19th century by people who wanted English to read more like Latin, which they thought was a more scholarly language. It's a form of [linguistic prescription]( URL_1 ), which basically means telling people how they ought to be speaking/writing. See also:  URL_0 
a small, homogeneous population with a culture of non-violence and their size generally keeps them out of geopolitical conflicts (except Austria... not so peaceful at times)
This is mostly an assumption, but: The rovers are sent to Mars for research. To take photographs and samples of most everything. If you want to investigate Mars, it's a bad idea to send a long a piece of Earth (e.g. dirt, minerals, bacteria) and then examine it on Mars. TL;DR: Don't get earth bacteria on your Mars samples.
The materials inside them actually degrade over time when used and recharged repeatedly. Due to this, they have a finite lifespan
Oceanic currents and wind patterns keep the weather on some coasts milder than on others. That is why the West Coast is much warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer than the East Coast of the US. Melbourne is protected from Antarctic weather systems by the Southern Ocean, while nothing stops polar winds from reaching NYC.
I don't know much about the situation in other countries, but I know a reasonable amount about the situation here, although I am a white Australian so I won't pretend to understand the full situation. The biggest problem is that indigenous Australians aren't one people, there's something like 300 separate nations. While they obviously share common ground, each group has different wants and needs so rather than trying to solve one problem you're trying to solve hundreds. There are various indigenous spokespeople, but some people don't like them either because they're from a different tribe or because they feel they've been whitewashed. All in all, even just organising a proper meeting to discuss the injustice indigenous Australians face (with all stakeholders involved) is a hard task, let alone actually solving the problems. In terms of actually solving the problems, a lot of indigenous people distrust whitefella institutions like hospitals and the like. Up until 1970 the government stole indigenous people from their families to be raised by white families, foster homes and the church. Since it's so recent, a decent proportion of the current indigenous population were involved in that and understandably don't want that to happen to their kids/grandkids. On a similar note, a big problem in indigenous communities is child abuse, which is normally solved by removing the child from their abusers. Obviously after the horrors of the stolen generation this is avoided wherever possible, which means the abuse continues and can propogate through generations. Another big thing is that Australia is so barren that some indigenous communities are so remote that it's hard to provide support, even where it's wanted. That said, a lot (but not all) of the more remote communities are happy living the way they do and we generally let them just do their thing. Death in custody is a big issue too. Obviously there's cases of police brutality and the like, but there's also a high suicide rate too. Indigenous Australians have a VERY strong connection to the land and their extended family and depriving them of that by incarcerating them causes extreme mental anguish, often driving them to end their lives. Those are just a few of the things that I could come up with off the top of my head. I don't pretend to fully understand the problem, but it's 2.30am in Australia. Hopefully someone who knows a bit more will reply in the morning.
Can confirm what others have said: They use retreaded tires on tractors in any position except steer (the very front two tires). Retreading is a system by which a used tire has new tread applied to it at a tire plant, thereby making it a "refurbished" tire. Retread tires are used on every position on a truck except the steer axle, only new tires go on steer axle (this is the very front two tires on a truck, if they are not new then they are against DOT regulation). Is it safe? By and large, yes, we have never had a major failure across the board in a retread campaign. Do I recommend driving next to a truck or a trailer on the highway? Absolutely not. It isn't even so much because of the tires but because of the driver, sitting on the side of one they usually won't see you, if there is a blowout the tread may hit your car and damage it severely (we have large steel belts, sort of like in your car, but unfurled they would be about the size of your car). Another thing is that if a retread blows then it could blow out other tires, the truck could swerve and destroy your car. If you are on city streets being next to a truck is a lot like being next to a car so I wouldn't worry there but on highways I would suggest sticking as far as you can away from a tractor, especially one that has a trailer attached because trailer tire retreads tend to be several times retreaded tractor tires. tl;dr tractors have copies of copies of copies of tires and therefore trend toward the weaker side. Source: I am a parts manager (that deals with tires every day) for a national trucking company.
It's kind of like being thirsty without water
A few items people don't seem to like: 1. Games have to be registered to a specific console. If you buy a game second-hand, you have to pay an additional fee for it. People don't like this because when it comes to physical media, a lot of gamers buy games used specifically because it's cheaper. 2. Many of the features explained at the reveal have nothing to do with gaming, making it hard for the demographic they're trying to appeal to particularly excited for them. The idea of watching TV through my game console, while nice, isn't likely to sell the system on its own. 3. Very few games actually got shown off. Sure, we know they've got 15-ish exclusive titles, but little disclosure as to what they are.
You use a semicolon when you want to join two related statements together, but don't want to use a 'joining word' like _but_ or _and_, or you don't want to imply as long a pause as a full stop/period. For example: *I went on vacation the other day; the flight was very long.* An important point is that both statements should be complete sentences in their own right. In other words you should be able to use a period instead of a semi-colon and still have both statements make sense.
For anyone who hasn't heard of this whole situation, here's a summary: Kim Davis is the County Clerk for Rowan County, Kentucky. After the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot ban same-sex marriage, she stopped giving out marriage licenses to any couple. Davis based her actions on the idea that same-sex marriage conflicts with her Christian beliefs, so she refuses to be involved with a marriage between people of the same sex. Davis took the matter to court, arguing that her religious views should excuse her from the aspects of her job that she considers immoral. The court did not accept her position, so she appealed, and again the courts said she could not stop issuing marriage licenses. While this was going on, Davis was granted a "stay," which basically said she could keep denying marriage licenses while the matter was in court. The stay just expired and the Supreme Court rejected an extension to the stay. As a result, it's pretty clear that Davis will not be able to get legal permission to continue avoiding issuing marriage licenses. In spite of the courts telling her she needs to issue the licenses, Davis still refuses to do so. By continuing to do this, she risks being fined or jailed at a later point in time. However, because County Clerk is an elected position, she cannot be fired. It is possible that she could impeached by the legislature, but that would not be a simple procedure. TL;DR: County Clerk refuses to give out marriage licenses, citing religious objections to same-sex marriage. Issue goes to court and all rulings go against her. Clerk continues to refuse to give out marriage licenses, but she can't just be fired or anything straightforward like that.
There are certain things that are common in human mythology, and one of them is that humans are predisposed to be impressed by really big things. And it's easier to imagine a really big version of something that already exists than to design something completely from scratch. Hence why so many cultures have stories of giant humans running around. This applies to other creatures as well; take a reptile of some sort, scale it up to being bigger than a house, and suddenly you've got a dragon of some kind. Imagination adds other embellishments such as horns or breathing fire, or whatever the local variation is. (And they can be pretty varied; consider the differences between a standard European dragon, a Chinese dragon, and the Aztec winged serpent -- but they're all basically big lizards.) Similarly, many cultures have stories of giant birds, be it the ~~European~~ Middle Eastern (thanks productusmaximus!) Roc or the North American Thunderbird. This of course gives rise to the question of why some animals don't seem to get the gargantuan myth treatment as often. To this I can only speculate that when one has to deal with actual bears and tigers and jaguars, stories about even larger ones aren't necessary for drama.
Making coffee at home is much more common than brewing beer at home. That's really all it is.
Despite the name of "national socialism" the Nazis were not actually socialist and very far from anything that could be considered socialist ideology. The Soviet union at least was in the same general ball park. They were communist with a Marxist–Leninist ideology. An extreme and specialized outgrowth of the general socialist ideology but socialism none the less. There are some conspiracy theories popular in places like the United states of America that would make you think that the Nazis were leftist or part of some communist, Jewish or homosexual conspiracy when they were very much the opposite of that and doing their best to persecute and kill everyone who actually was. The Nazis were far right and the Soviets were far left. Due to the nature of the political spectrum the two extreme points actually did have some things in common. Many of the things they had did have in common were however less outgrowth of their respective ideologies but rather a result of them both being undemocratic and not tolerating dissent as well as accumulating as much power as possibly at the top and removing possible competitors. Nazism was all about race and with some great mythology build around the concept how the Aryan race was destined to throw of the shackles of the lesser race and eventually rule. Communism had a completely different ideology that was less centered around race and more around the fact that their political ideology was destined to eventually overcome all others. Both were willing to bend and twist their ideologies to suit their needs, even to the point of briefly allying with each other despite being on the face of it natural enemies.
You technically could, sure. It'd be the same way you learned your first language. Over time, you begin to associate nouns with actual things on the screen, verbs with actions you see, and adjectives from how things look/sound/whatever. If you saw someone walk into a room, and the man behind the desk said "por favor siéntate", and the person sat down, eventually, you'd learn that this phrase, in some way, likely means 'sit down'. You'd then notice that 'por favor' is used when someone is asking for something. you could then intuit that 'siéntate' means to sit, and 'por favor' means to ask nicely for something. Eventually you'd pick up on the patterns, but it's not like a weekend of spanish soap operas would really *teach* you spanish. It would certainly take time. Enough exposure would eventually work to some extent, though.
Pure mathematician here. Just to add to the comments below (or, will be below once you upvote this comment - zing!): Pure mathematics, as a discipline, originates from the process of successively abstracting the ideas of concrete math. In other words, it looks for the essential structural features that make concrete math "work," without the nonessential, context clues that make it concrete. Think of it like building a taxonomy of the animal kingdom by studying a bunch of animals, classifying them into categories based on their common features, then classifying those categories into categories based on *their* common features, and so on. For example, one path in mathematics might be Euclidean geometry - >  [inner product functions]( URL_5 ) - >  [norm functions]( URL_3 ) - >  [metrics or distance functions]( URL_1 ) - >  [topologies]( URL_0 ) - >  [sets]( URL_2 ) - >  [foundational axioms]( URL_4 ). At each step, "structure is lost," meaning that you sacrifice some of the special properties of each for the sake of putting concepts into successively bigger groups, like squares passing to rectangles passing to quadrilaterals to polygons, or bumblebees passing to bees passing to order hymenoptera to class insecta. Anyway, the "facts" which hold these classifications together and connect among them are called theorems, which in order to be accepted must be able to be logically deduced from the accepted theorems "above it" in abstraction. For example, you can prove a statement about squares using facts about rectangles, but not vice versa. (That's what makes it deductive reasoning.) The thing is, just like we could discover a new species of bee tomorrow, we could discover some new fact about a mathematical system that hasn't yet been deduced. Or, perhaps more commonly, we could discover a proof -- pure math's standard of demonstrating logical deduction -- for something that mathematicians "believe" to be true based on their knowledge of the field. How would you do that? The same way you discover a new species of bee: get familiar enough with all the existing species so that you can spot the one specimen that doesn't fit the pattern, or a new pattern that no one has spotted before. In math this means immersing yourself in all the recently discovered theorems in your field, looking at how their knowledge was constructed from more general and related principles. And then go immerse yourself in those more general and related theories to understand how they work. And so on. Naturally, you typically have to start with learning a lot of general knowledge in the field, growing more specialized as you go. And then, reading a paper, you spot a theorem that you can take one step further down the line. From a logical perspective, this usually takes the form of a hypothesis you can weaken ("All red squares are rectangles..." Wait a minute, they don't need to be red!) or a conclusion you can strengthen ("All squares are quadrilaterals..." Wait a minute, they're more specifically rectangles!) And then you embark upon constructing a proof, borrowing recent results as well as general knowledge and often a stroke of insight and creativity to form the logical scaffold of the work. You write up your proof, submit it for publication, present it at conferences, teach it to your graduate students, rinse, and repeat. The last paragraph is probably an answer to what you were asking - the "process" of pure math research is difficult to describe because it is so often a slow, deliberative, and creatively frustrating search for the right pieces and the right way to put them together, like being in a room full of mismatched puzzle pieces and trying to put together a picture of the specific dog you had as a child. It can be years of labor for small amounts of progress, and there's no accepted procedure, just as there's no fixed procedure for designing great sculpture. But at least from my end, the few rewards pale in comparison to the thrill of the hunt. If you have the chance to pursue pure math even for a while in university, take it! TL;DR: Boil math down to its essential features. Look for hypotheses to weaken or conclusions to strengthen, and try to prove it.
They did! There were all kinds of diseases that people were introduced to in the new world that they didn't have in the old world. There's a fascinating book by Charles C Mann called 1493 - it's an exploration of everything that occurred after the "discovery" of the new world. I really suggest giving it a read
Your car stereo uses active echo cancellation. It know what signal it's sending out of the speakers so it compares the signal it's picking up on the mic to the signal it's send out the speakers and tries to remove anything that is the same in both. This is the same technology that works on your cell phone and on modern table stop speaker phones.
War is political. Preemptive strikes can be real but just as often it's just an excuse to start some shit for ulterior motives. North Korea on the other hand is... * No serious threat * Has nothing America wants, ie. not worth starting shit over * War with North Korea will cause massive trouble The Iraq and Afghanistan conflict caused America to nose dive further into debt and everyone is struggling to stabilize the countries and clean up the mess. Let's assume a NK conflict is swiftly won and NK get's "liberated". There are now some 24 million North Koreans from a dysfunctional nation unloaded on the world. That's a pretty big burden to deal with. So in short, there's no pre emptive strikes because there's no real threat and nobody wants to make NK their problem.
Most of this new refugee wave are refugees from the Syrian civil war and the following conflicts. Syrian civil war started in 2011 and during that civil unrest ISIS/ISIL also gained great foothold, now (according to Wikipedia) controlling an area with 10 million people spanning [large areas of Syria and Iraq]( URL_0 ) (gray area in this map). When looking from Syria, the route to east takes them to ISIS controlled areas of Iraq. After that there, Iran, which is a [huge country]( URL_1 ) and authoritarian. It's also worth noting that most of the refugees from Middle East are to other Middle Eastern countries. So a lot of them are in countries like Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. The "European refugee crisis" news only tells about the refugees who try to come to Europe.
It won't matter , even if they see different variations you both agree it's red. so hues to say which variant is better.
Shock is the name for any time when your tissues need more oxygen than your body can provide. Examples are if you have lost blood (hemorrhagic shock) or if your heart is pumping too weakly (cardiogenic). In septic shock, the blood vessels dilate and are leaky so supply drops, and the oxygen demand is higher due to the infection and inflammation.
Yes. This is actually how some of those fancy no-flush urinals work: your pee sinks below a layer of oil, so it won't evaporate and stink up the place.
This is extremely common and well known to occur after smoking cannabis. The main compound in cannabis that gets you high, THC, is a powerful vasodilator! This means that THC lowers blood pressure and widens the veins and capillaries throughout your body, including the ones in your eyes, allowing for more blood flow to these areas. This dilation of blood vessels is also why many people experienced a flushed/red face when high on cannabis, and the drop in blood pressure explains why many people may feel dizzy while high.
The key to China's control over their exchange rate is their capital controls. That, and a central bank with extraordinarily large quantities of dollars and yuan to spend to defend the exchange rate. Germany and many other Western countries used to have a policy of fixed exchange rates. That changed when savvy people with lots of money figured out that they could "attack" the fixed rate. How they "attacked" the exchange rate is by borrowing vast quantities of German marks and buying British pounds at the fixed rate. Many investors repeated this until the German banks no longer could afford to sell pounds and buy marks to keep the exchange rate constant. At that point, the price of marks went down, the investors traded back and paid off their loans, and pocketed the difference. This process is simply not possible with China, since China does not allow currency traders to do the things they need to do to attack the exchange rate. Furthermore, the Chinese central bank has vast quantities of USD that they can use to defend the exchange rate.
No, because for it to be considered discrimination, they have to refuse service to a protected class because they are a protected class. Protected classes are * Religion * National Origin/Ethnicity * Race * Gender Now, you couldn't refuse the Westboro Baptist Church because of their religion, but you could refuse them because you refuse to service that particular group because of what they do. Similarly, I could refuse to my barn out to the Black Panthers, not because of their race but because of the organization itself. Let's say you own a pizza place. There is a couple waiting for pizza that is sucking each other's face. You could kick them out because they are making other people uncomfortable, regardless of whether or not they are gay, because it's what they are actively doing. Discrimination would be if you actively refused service to particular people because of their particular standing in one of the protected classes. But, at the same time it isn't discrimination if you create a business centred around catering specifically to a particular group. ie, a woman's only gym, a gay only bar, a men's club, etc.

In terms of meat I would imagine it's down to the consistency and texture of the cut as well as the amount of fat to be found. Human beings may or may not be delicious, depending on whether or not you're a fan of veal. [William Seabrook]( URL_0 ) was a guy from about a hundred years ago who got to try out some human meat while on a trip to Guinea. He had this so say: "It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable." Veal is really tender and flavourful and fatty, so if you've got taste buds like most of the rest of us, you'd probably find TASTING your BUD to be a pretty yummy experience.
It's a cynical statement that you can't win by playing by the rules, you have to have some kind of advantage, or be willing to bend rules (or outright cheat) to get by in whatever situation they're talking about. It is used in different situations from career to romance.
For my own sake I try to browse news sources from all over the world. This tends to cut down on specific left/right narratives for a specific region and allows you to extract just the relevant facts of the story. Some discretion and intelligence is needed
The pyramids were built using ramps and pulleys and thousands of workers who labored for decades. There are conspiracy theories about them simply because they are old and big and unique. There are very few buildings around that are as old as the pyramids -- 4000 years. People wonder why anyone would build something as huge and impractical as a pyramid. But we simply do not know enough about ancient Egypt to explain everything about them.
I Like /u/mod_maj_gen explanation best, but I always understood it to be that when put into shock, your body will very quickly stop any non-essential processes in order to preserve energy for the "flight or Fight Response". One of these non-essential processes is digestion and explains not only the "sick to your stomach" feeling, but also the "butterflies in your tummy" feeling when you are nervous.
For the same reason America is sports oriented. It makes money (collectively), it's entertaining, it's considered healthy, and it's fun/social.
There aren't really any moving parts in a phone. I'd probably guess that the only moving parts were the motor that drives the vibration and I suppose the speaker that vibrates for sound. The non-moving parts aren't really effected by being vibrated assuming they are reasonably well constructed. Some electronic devices (like a laptop) do have moving parts and are more likely to sustain problems if moved around or vibrated too much.
I think it's more like, "How can I make what the Founding Fathers said appear to fit/support my viewpoint?" People have respect for their beliefs and viewpoints because those ideas shaped the county they live in currently, which also makes it a matter of patriotism. I think others then use that respect as a way of backing up their own, personal ideology.
It's a new technology with a geometric make-up that has a specific effect on electricity and other things like water. Because it's such a low level technology its implications are vast. This is because it's quite generic to work with materials at such a small scale. The more generic something is the bigger impact it can have. Edit: [ELI5 Friendly]( URL_0 )
Right-wing politics largely centers around a small, efficient government, low taxation, low regulation, and relies on the free market. This goes hand in hand with the rejection of authority - and religious people believe in a divine authority far more powerful and important than an Earthly government. Thus, they do not trust their government to have a hand in more things than the bare minimum, and their allegiance is to God, not the government.
Long exposure is one way to do it, yes, but astrophotographers also use a technique called "stacking", where they stack multiple layers of shorter exposure pictures over one another. Some people prefer to use this method over taking a single long exposure because it's usually easier to fine tune your picture. For example, if your camera runs out of battery, or something moves in shot that shouldn't be there, or you accidentally bump the camera, it's a lot easier to edit that in post processing and simply remove those frames rather than have your whole long exposure ruined. Also, this method might cut your shooting time in half. But stacking isn't better than long exposure or vice versa and it's really all up to the person taking the picture to decide.
Look closely at your cheerios floating on milk. You should be able to see the milk curling up around the cheerio, forming a little skirt of bent milk. [The cheerios cling to both each-other and the wall.]( URL_0 ) It takes force to bend the surface of water. A single cheerio has force from that bent surface pushing all around it evenly. It doesn't move because the force is even. If you put two cheerios near each-other their little skirts of bent milk overlap. The milk doesn't have to bend as much in the area between the two cheerios. That means that area doesn't push on the cheerios as much. So with force all around but weaker in the direction of the other cheerio, the cheerios get pushed together by the milk around them. This is also the case with the side of the bowl.
Obnoxious hormones. It was novel to me to see such drastic changes. I liked that I became curvy, but just standing made me short of breath, and sleeping was a struggle. Depending on the hormones, I felt one way or another. It's similar to drinking in that you have happy drunks and angry drunks, and it's usually based on how they felt before they started drinking.
Glasses have two effects: focus, and magnification. The focus is what you want to change. The reason you need glasses is that your eyes are miscalibrated, and they need a focus adjustment. The magnification is a side effect and generally not wanted. It's the reason that people with powerful lenses look like their eyes are either way too small (nearsighted) or way too big (farsighted) - the lens is changing the apparent size of their eyes. The reverse happens, too: your new glasses are putting objects in focus, but they're also distorting their apparent size. If you're nearsighted and you just got a more powerful prescription, objects look slightly smaller than they used to. That messes with your depth perception, because your brain thinks everything is slightly farther away than it is. The depth perception distortion will go away as your brain adjusts to the new relationship between how big something looks and how far away it is.
She was billed as invincible, she was the biggest passenger liner built at the time and they had one of the most experienced crews of White Star Line at the helm. Unfortunately a chain of completely avoidable errors caused the accident, including the ship having the absolute legal minimum of life boats which was the start of the problem. A last minute reshuffle of senior crew meant that the holder of the key to the cupboard that contained the binoculars ended up not going with the ship, and he simply forgot to hand the key back over. Numerous warnings from ships nearby (notably the Californian which was close by and had stopped surrounded by icebergs) were pushed aside by overworked radio operators who were busy sending and receiving passenger messages. The iceberg was spotted very late due to a moonless night and eerily calm waters, meaning there were no waves crashing against the bottom of the icebergs. Once it was apparent the iceberg was there, First Officer Murdoch attempted a manoeuvre to swing the front of the ship round to the left, and then push the rear of the ship outwards using the propellers in a move called a port-about. However the delay involved in switching the engines to reverse caused the ship to adopt a slow sideways drift towards the berg. Many experts believe that if Murdoch had simply turned the ship at its current speed, it would avoided the collision by some feet. Once the collision had taken place, the Captain was roused and almost immediately told by the ships designer that sinking within 2 hours was a 'mathematical certainty'. The Captain became paralysed with indecision and gave no orders other than to rouse the passengers and put their life jackets on. Prompted by other officers onboard, he ordered the lifeboats to be loaded and lowered saying "women and children first". However the officer in charge of one side of the ships evacuation took it as "women and children ONLY" and therefore dramatically reduced the amount of passengers to be saved. It is believed the Captain never officially ordered to abandon ship, or even evacuate, with many officers and staff working on their own initiative. The Californian had shut its radios down for the night, and even though both radio operators on the Titanic worked tirelessly sending distress messages (even the yet to be introduced SOS signal), the closest ship was 4 hours away. The Carpathia made full steam through the minefield of icebergs towards the ship that had given its position as 15 nautical miles from where it actually was. The Captain of this ship was later credited with saving nearly every possible survivor. The Titanic shot rockets from the deck which was seen by the Californian, however the Captain elected to ignore them. The sinking of the Titanic was a major wake up call for the authorities to start tightening procedures and regulation, as well as the media attention it received. Imagine the inaugural flight of the Airbus A380 crashing - it would hit news big time. I'm probably missing out a few details as well as having forgotten the vast majority of the crew members' names, but I've given the just of what happened and hopefully it helps. I'm sure there are some redditors that are considerably more knowledgeable than I on the subject that can point out any mistakes.
Fabric softeners that make towels nice and fluffy also make them slightly more water proof so they tend to absorb less efficiently.
This isn't really a good ELI5 type question because the answer depends on a lot of different stuff. How clean you are completely depends on what kinds of dirt were on you before you got in the shower, what you used for cleansers, and how well you rinsed off. You do sweat some in the shower but it's just slightly saltier water that gets washed away with everything else. But if you had a really hot and long shower that raised your body temperature and you're stepping out into a hot room, you'll continue to sweat some as you exit the shower, at least until your body cools down.

The point of freedom of speech is that it's not up to you to decide what is "awful filth". You think it is, which is fine, but the people who post there (not me) don't. To ban their stuff would be to say that your opinion was more important than theirs. Also, it's easy enough to not be subscribed and never have that stuff show up.
Because that kind of colour pattern is often linked to the X chromosome. As you know, females have two X chromosomes, so they're most likely to have calico coats.
There is a big misconception that things aren't changing in Africa. In reality countries like Nigeria are developing at quite a fast rate. The issue affecting their development is partly do do with structural issues. Political systems are pretty weak in comparison to western standards as there are lots of interests and the way in which they developed differs from the west. At the same time there are lots of internal issues to do with different ethnicities being lumped together in states (Like in Nigeria, there is a Christian south and Muslim North). So in terms of internal development, quite a lot of African states are making progress. At the same time, sending aid such as food can undercut the local produce in terms of cost. So nowadays other rising powers have alternatives such as investing in infrastructure in return for natural resources. An example is China, who will build Hydropower dams in return for resources, the benefit being that China doesn't demand a lot from them. Some African countries are more exposed to disasters such as famine due to the weather and other things like climate change and desertification. This makes developing a stable economy quite difficult. It is still important to give to these charities, as charities such as Save the Children invest in medicine for countries which lack the support for there. If an economy is to develop, it needs to make sure its workforce is sustainable and the government needs to be able to invest in growth at the same time as protecting its citizens. So sending money to them can help these countries develop faster in the long term. A good thing to get a copy of if you want to find out how diverse, developed and modern their systems are is the Africa Report.  URL_0  *to be honest, Africa is such a massive continent with a huge number of people, it causes depend on what country you are looking at.*
Usually this happens when the application runs into an error (stack overflow, access a file that doesn't exist). Imagine the computer is a person who just dropped their stuff on the ground, and the computer freezing is them picking it up. They're so concentrated on fixing the problem, they put all their resources to fix it, including the processing power needed to move your cursor. Hope this helps
There are lots of good reasons restarting your router might fix the speed, lets list them: * Your neighbors suck: Are lots of people stealing WiFi from you? Rebooting your router probably forced them to connect to a different network thus freeing up bandwidth for you. This can also be true of all the online devices in your house. * Your ISP sucks: Some internet service providers like to slow down the traffic of users that they catch using specific protocols (like bit torrents and encryption) which is technically illegal if they do it before killing net neutrality, but there is lots of evidence they have been doing it anyways. By restarting your router you are effectively requesting a new IP address from your ISP and that may also reset any bad things they have done to your connection. * Your router sucks: Routers are little computers. They have memory and processors and they run software just like your computer but cheaper. It is possible that simply running for a long time makes your router slow down from internal memory leaks due to bad design/firmware. * Your computer sucks: When you restart the router every service using the internet on your computer is forced to briefly accept the fact that there is no internet anymore. If one of those services was causing horrible connection issues (like some background update service), then there is a chance restarting the router will force it to end early, thus freeing your computer once the router comes back online. * You suck: There are lots of reasons that something on the internet may seem slow for a while and then seem fast later. If your evidence is "it seems faster after restarting" I might ask to see your data.
First year surveyor here. The tripods which surveyors use are just devices for holding instruments level. There's many instruments which surveyors use, but the most common would be the total station. This has a telescope on it which is used to sight a target or point, from which the angle and distance to that point can be calculated. Other instruments include; levels which are used for calculating heights, gps systems for positioning and prisms which are used as targets for total stations. Basically surveyors are using various instruments to find the spatial position of different points on the earth.
Many horror films lack any kind of impactful storytelling. They often rely on gruesome visuals, jump-scares, and patently absurd plots. This cheapens the whole genre, and makes it harder for people to take them seriously. As you said, there are exceptions.
One reason is because they can - they control your ability to connect to the internet from almost wherever you want, so they can charge more for it than you would pay for home internet. Another reason is that it costs them a fair bit of money to build and maintain that network, so the cost gets passed on to you, the customer.
Typically when using the word "efficiency" in a comparative fashion for energy production the measurement refers to the source-energy relative to the converted usable energy. E.G. if gasoline has X amount of energy in it, the combustion engine can only create about X*.3 of that to its usable energy (movement, in this case). A solar panel converts about 20ish percent of the suns energy. If we compare that to other forms of _electricity_ production (the most reasonable analogue for your not-well-defined statement) then we'd be saying that "compared to the efficiency of capture of energy from coal and conversion to electricity, solar panels are significantly less efficient". The REASON we might emphasize this statement however is that increasing efficiency of the panel in this dimension is correlated with requiring less physical space, likely high return on investment of actual purchase of the panels and so on. Its perceived that improved efficiency - amongst other things - is the path towards more economic viability for widespread solar.
Domestic violence was not really decriminalized, they decriminalized the first offence. You still get a punishment for it, but if you and your wife had a big fight and it escalated to a physical one that ended *without injury* and that was the only time it's happened then you won't get in huge trouble but you still lose more than five hundred USD, 15 days jail time, or 120 days community service. You will get in bigger trouble if it happens again.
1: They didn't occupy all of China, only parts of the coastline. 2: China was in the middle of a Civil War between the communists and the nationalists, they weren't prepared for an invasion. The two factions did band together to repel the Japanese, but it was an uneasy alliance, and by 1938 it was breaking down. 3: China wasn't exactly the most technologically advanced nation at the time of the Second Sino-Japanese war. For example, they still used biplanes while the Japanese Air Force had actual fighters. 4: Not only were the Chinese technologically inferior, they also had less of everything except manpower. Take a look at the chart [here]( URL_0 ). In 1939 Japan had almost 5 times the aircraft, 4 times the tanks, and 1.5 times field artillery. By 1941, the ratios got even worse. 5: Japanese soldiers were fanatics during battle. Officers often stressed the importance of no retreat, of death over dishonor. This led to Japanese troops achieving victories from the brink of defeat. 6: Japan had the resources to control major cities, but lacked the manpower to lock down the vast countryside, where the Chinese would often launch guerrilla strikes. And by 1941, when the USA joined the war, Japan had to reallocate resources to another front.
The British were in control and didn't care at all about the Irish population. They made the Irish grow wheat to export and forced them to grow potatoes to eat. When the potato failed, there was nothing left, and the British were not about to give up their profits for humanitarian concerns, especially not for Catholics. If there had been a revolt, the British would have slaughtered thousands with their superior weaponry and organization. They'd done it many times before. If you ever wonder why groups like the IRA and Sinn Fein exist, centuries of behavior like this is it. Not saying terrorism is justified, but being angry at the British over this history absolutely is.
In situations where the username is used as a displayed name, case sensitive usernames would enable someone to attempt to impersonate someone else just by registering a new account with a different permutation of capital/lowercase letters. The same applies for web domains. For emails, case sensitive addresses would result in a lot of undelivered emails from someone forgetting which letters were capitalized or not. Etc. Also worth noting that some companies, like Wells Fargo, do not use case sensitive passwords as an added convenience to the user. For passwords, passwords are supposed to be arbitrary, are not stored in plain text or ever displayed, and allowing case sensitive passwords enables a massively wider range of possible passwords to discourage guessing.
The controversy over the drones is not really about the drones themselves. The controversy is that Obama used a drone to kill a US citizen. US citizens should be provided due process (a trial, the opportunity to offer a defense, etc.). This drone strike violates that principle, even in the most narrow readings of the law.
A very complicated series of checks by several different government agencies. It takes a long time and gathers as much data as it can to make an assessment of need and risk. Great infogrraphic (ELI12) here:  URL_0 
I think one of the biggest ones is that your spouse becomes your legal 'next of kin', meaning you can make medical decisions for them, own their property after they die, etc. If you aren't married you are not legally a part of that person's life, so any legal or medical decisions would be up to the parents of that individual. That's why marriage equality was important a few years ago. If someone was with their partner for 15 years and then suddenly dropped dead, their partner had better hope their in-laws liked them or even supported the partnership in the first place. If not, the parents could just take the house and all the money (provided the person didn't have a will). There are probably other benefits, but I think this is one of the big ones.
Theoretically, there are such places (relative to our frame of reference). However, we can't see them because the universe was not [transparent]( URL_0 ) until about 400 thousand years after the big bang, or the universe was expanding faster than the speed of light at the time. --- Edit: I probably mistook the question. My answer talks about the appearance of the universe due to the time it takes for photons to reach us. But time dilation is to do with relativistic effects such as matter moving relative to each other in actual space, or regions of high gravity.
I'll attempt to provide some info on the second point. There's a difference between biological sex and gender identity. Your biological sex is assigned at birth based on biological characteristics, male or female. This is in most cases a binary, except in the case of individuals born with ambiguous sexual characteristics, often termed "intersex" individuals because their biological sex falls somewhere between simple "male" or "female". "Gender" is socially constructed, meaning that we as societies and individuals determine what it means to be male or female. Behavior, appearance, dress, speech, all are examples of gender norms. Gender roles change over time and space, meaning that what it means to be a woman or a man means different things in different places. People referring to there being more than 2 genders may be in reference to the idea that gender is fluid, or is kind of like a spectrum. People express their gender identity in shades- for instance, some women wear dresses, some women wear pants, some men are masculine, some men are less masculine- there are thousands of ways to express gender.
US Foreign aid breaks down roughly as follows: 15 billion - Rebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan, which are two countries where we started wars. We feel responsible for trying to repair some of the damage. 3 billion - Military aid for Israel. Mostly in the form of expensive weapons. Without our assistance, Israel would almost certainly get attacked by one of their neighbors (who do not like Israel). 4 billion - Economic and Military aid for Pakistan, Egypt, and Jordan. The goal is to have a few people in the mideast who call us allies. Essentially, we buy their cooperation. That cooperation is sometimes useful. For example, when we killed Osama Bin Laden, we sent troops into Pakistan. Normally, countries don't tolerate troops from other countries. The Pakistanis did complain a little, but they didn't do anything about it. That's what we're buying. 10 billion - Assorted disaster zones around the world. For example, we send 1 billion to Haiti, which is where that horrible tsunami/earthquake happened. A lot of this is done in a spirit of charity, but there's also an element of self-interest. Many of these areas have unstable governments or no governments, and we're hoping that if they do get stable governments, the new government will be friendly to us. Just for perspective: the total money spent by the US government on our *own* citizens and our *own* military is 3,500 billion, that is, roughly 100x more than we spend on foreign aid.
A lock has a number of tumblers, which all need to be pushed to a certain height in order for the lock to turn. Each key is unique, and the bumps on the key correspond to the heights of the tumblers within the corresponding lock. Imagine keys and locks as a 6 digit password. Now imagine that your kitchen lock is only a 4 digit password - the kitchen lock only has 4 tumblers, not 6. So your keys can all open the kitchen door if they have the right 4 bumps, but you can't open each other's doors. Imagine the kitchen door is 0134. Imagine your door is 013461 and your roommate's door is 013413. You and your roommate can both open the kitchen because your keys have 0134 (which is all the kitchen needs,) but you can't open each other's doors because your keys don't match the lock.
There are several reasons: * There's an aversion to food that "comes from a lab," as it were. * Selective breeding is generally between crops that are the same or very similar. Genetic modification allows traits from other species to be incorporated into the crop (if you want a tomato that doesn't freeze in a cold snap, you could take genes from a fish that lives in frigid Arctic water, for example). That freaks people out. * GMOs are largely controlled by a handful of corporations, the most notable of which is Monsanto. These are companies that people aren't too fond of, and they use some pretty heavy handed business tactics to shut out any smaller competitors. *Edited for word choice*
The clue is the less protection part. In a car you have a safe cage around the occupants and a lot of crumple zones and airbags to keep you save in the event of a crash. So the best place to be is firmly in place strapped inside the car to the seat where all the protection works best. However in a motorcycle there is nothing protecting you in a crash. You are already sitting on the outside of the vehicle. So the best way to avoid injury is to get away from any potential heavy pieces of wreckage as possible. You would rather have the bike hit something after you have gotten away then if you were squished in the middle of the collision. This is why motorcyclists have protection to their bodies instead of on the vehicle. The helmet, suit, boots and gloves are designed to give someone good protection from smaller bumps and scrapes which make a collision survivable as long as you are able to get away from the biggest impacts.
A little late to post, but I have some knowledge in this. First off, the two things you mention are very different. **Venomous** means that the creature (animal) is capable of injecting toxins by means of a bite or a sting. **Toxic** creatures (also including things like caterpillars and poison arrow frogs) are not safe to eat because they have toxins in their bodies (or leaves/stems/flowers/roots/berries). Poisonous plants are generally considered toxic. (For true ELI5, scroll down to the TL;DR) Now the two are very different evolutionarily but they do have a common component: making toxins is metabolically expensive. That means that it takes a lot of energy to make toxins. It only makes sense to produce toxins if there is a lot of evolutionary pressure to do so. In fact there have been studies done on plants that suggests when non-native species are introduced to a new area, because there are usually less predators that feed on them in the new area, they tend to lose the potency of their toxicity (the study was specifically on weedy plant species). ** Now, a lot of people in this thread have made two claims: A) that there is a lot less biodiversity in cooler climates (which is true) and B) that human populations have been a driving factor in eliminating venomous/toxic species. To address the second point: this is obviously not the case because there are plenty of toxic/venomous species in tropical areas with high human populations. In fact, regions like Siberia and Canada have a very low human population and fewer venomous/toxic species and places like India and Nigeria have high populations of human and high populations of venomous species. To address the biodiversity claim, thats partially true. Since there are fewer species further north (because there are fewer resources like sunlight), this results in fewer overall numbers of venomous/toxic species. I would argue, however, that there is still a similar percentage of *toxic* species, compared to the tropics. For example there are plenty of toxic caterpillar species (monarch butterfly, for example) and, some amphibian species (Pickerel frog) and many toxic plant species (hemlock, or poison ivy). But that does not address the lack of *venomous* species in northern climates. There are examples, such as many spiders, and bees and wasps, but venomous species make up a smaller percentage of species than warmer climates. The reason for this is two fold: evolution and size. Venomous species tend to have evolved in a couple specific groups. The list includes: spiders, bees/wasps/ants, snakes, a handful of truly venomous lizards (the Gila monster), centipedes, jellyfish, many species of fish, and some mammals. When looking at the list, every singles species that is venomous is cold blooded (ectothermic) with the exception of mammals. When looking at the mammals that are venomous they are all very primitive: insectivores such as shrews, and the platypus (male only). It has been proposed that the reason most mammals never evolved a need for venom is because mammals evolved much stronger jaw bones and jaw muscles than their ancestors the lizards and snakes. Mammals were capable of actively killing their prey with their newly evolved jaws, teeth and retractable claws, whereas most reptiles killed more passively. This makes sense, being ectothermic, that snakes (as well as spiders, scorpions, jellyfish, fish etc) kill their prey with a single bite/sting, and then wait for the animal to die, exerting less energy overall. The venom found in the few species of shrew is a little bit different. From Wikipedia:  > Shrews cache various prey in a comatose state, including earthworms, insects, snails, and to a lesser extent, small mammals such as voles and mice. This behaviour is an adaption to winter. In this context, the shrew venom acts as a tool to sustain a living hoard, thus ensuring food supply when capturing prey is difficult. Keep in mind that these shrews are insectivores, meaning that they only eat insects and small vertibrates, no nuts/berries. Comparing this to mice, which do eat nuts and berries, despite their similar size, the mouse jawbow is much stronger than their shrew counterpart. There are handful of venomous shrews, no known venomous mice. Coming back to the main point, there is one species of toxic mammal in Europe, the european mole, which does use it venom to paralyze earthworms. It is likely that mice, being able to store nuts/berries through the winter, AND eat insect in the warmer months, are better equipped to survive in colder months than the weaker jawed shrew. The second point I was going to make was about colder climates, size and body temperature. Bergmann's rule states that generally: the further north you go, the larger the size of the animals. The theory behind this is that when an animal is larger, it's volume increases faster than surface area, making it relatively easier to maintain a constant temperature. Likewise in warmer climates, a smaller body sheds heat faster than larger body. There are exceptions to this, there are mice that live in cold areas and elephants that live in warm areas, but both within species and among species this rule is generally true. For example, in western hemisphere, the white tailed deer live from Venezuela, all the way up to Canada. The tropical subspecies of the deer are significantly smaller than their arctic brethren. Why is this important when talking about venom? Well, the larger the prey, the stronger the venom required to bring down the prey. The stronger the venom (usually) the more expensive it is to metabolically produce. And remember, the northern climates already have less energy available in the food chain than tropical climates. This likely helps to explain why we never see something like poisonous wolves or big cats, as stronger jaws are better at killing large prey faster than a very expensive to produce toxin. The one time we do see something like this is in the Komodo dragon, which is a more passive "venom". The lizard will bite it's large prey and then just follow, chill and wait, sometimes a week or more, for the beast to die. (Originally the thought was that the venom is bacterial, recent research has called that into question, as the venom may be an anticoagulant that then encourages infection of the open wound). Since the Komodo Dragon lives in a warm climate, they have less of an issue waiting for an animal to die, compared to a wolf which needs to maintain it's body temperature in the cold climate. **TL;DR**: *Toxic* plants and animals do exist in northern climates. *Venomous* creatures aren't as well represented because northern climates tend to favor larger animals, especially mammals, who have other adaptations like strong jaws that make venom unnecessary. ** (Not ELI5, but a couple people have asked me about metabolic cost of toxin production, specifically in snakes. I was taught, back in the early 2000's that it was more expensive to produce more powerful toxins, but in doing some quick research to answer their question, it seems that the research has changed. Studies [here]( URL_0 ) (caution paywall) and [here]( URL_1 ) both suggest the cost of snake toxin production is quite low. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I standby the plant studies that plants, over generations without evolutionary pressure, will begin to reduce toxin production in favor of growth (the 'non-native plant species exposed to new lands' study I alluded above).
comformation bias, there are very venomous and poisous animals all over the world alstalia just happens to have a few of the most.
People who are blind from birth won't visualize anything, such as their thoughts. It's difficult for them to understand the concept of seeing something, let alone actually seeing something in their mind. Someone who has experienced sight but then became blind probably will continue to visualize things in their mind. It'll be harder over time, the longer they go without being able to see.
Because when it was named "the moon" no one knew that other moons existed. Its the same story with the sun, for a long time no one knew other suns existed BONUS EXPLAINER: The first non-moon moons were discovered orbiting Jupiter by Galileo, helping to disprove the geocentric model. Giordano Bruno, the first person to seriously suggest that the sun is just another star was burned at the stake for doing so EDIT: Grammar
Clown's costumes distort and exaggerate their features for humorous effect. However, we naturally find feature distortions as worrying or frightening because deformities are indicative of disease. There's also the uncanny valley effect, in which we find things that are *almost* human in appearance far more disturbing than things that are obviously fake, probably for the same reason. Children are less easily able to tell that clowns are fake and are thus more likely to fear them, a fear that can carry over to adulthood.
There is nothing illegal about putting OSX on PC hardware. Apple makes it inconvenient, because they want to ensure a certain standard of quality for their products. And, they make most of their money selling their hardware, so they want to be sure you're buying that instead of the competitors stuff with their OS tacked on.
Is it maybe because you think they could never view you as a viable mate so your brain stops you from considering them as one?
Pigments (such as paint) were made primarily from lapis lazuli,c cobalt, and azurite. Which are all minerals. Dyes (for clothes and such) were made from plants such as woad. [Source]( URL_0 )
Don't know what the second one is but can answer for ibuprofen. It belongs to a class of drugs knows as nonsteroidal anti-inflammitory drugs(NSAIDS). Basically inflammation is your body ramping things up to deal with a situation. This involves the release of chemicals that cause inflammation, which(among other things) create pain through direct contact with nerves. They also create fever through a number of mechanisms that basically serves to create a hot hostile environment for what ever is invading your body and increase blood flow to the affected area. NSAIDS work by reducing the amount of these inflammatory chemicals being released in the first place.
They wear the gloves to help prevent the juices from getting into eyes and other places they shouldn't get, which are extremely sensitive and will suffer permanent damage. Your stomach on the other hand is designed to eat stuff that may be dangerous for your eyes (think lemon juice).
You may be surprised to know there are quite a few reasons. Among the most important are craftsmanship, attention to detail, brand pedigree and popularity. The precious metal cases aside, one of the largest factors is the craftsmanship a high-end watch's movement. The movement is what makes the watch tick. I'll save the complex talk for another article, but what is important to note is that a high-end watch typically uses a hand-made, super-accurate automatic movement. These movements are constructed of very small gears, springs and synthetic jewels to prevent friction. So small, in fact, that even a speck of dust can through off the accuracy of a watch. If you compared an expensive watch to a to low-end, you would notice that the more expensive of the two is made of much nicer materials and that everything just seems to look and feel right. I know, it sounds so corny, but it's true. The high-quality watch has the right amount of polish, the movement sounds right (the ticks), the crown clicks and functions flawlessly and the band is heavy duty. And I could write a whole article just about the math and styling behind watch dials. Sure, there is all of this attention to detail, but how can a watch be worth in excess of $10,000. Well, you'd be an idiot to think that watch value is based on those details alone. Many of the best watch brands are rich in history and extremely trusted. When buying a top-tier watch, there is no doubt that you'll be paying a pretty penny to be a part of that history. Lastly, high demand of expensive watches allow them to be priced much higher than most other watches. If people will buy a watch for thousands of dollars, you can bet your life that a brand will charge that much.
**$1 at a time** In some countries the app costs $1 to download, in others the first year is free and every subsequent year will cost the user $1. And with roughly 700M active users this results in $700M of annual revenue. However, WhatsApp has been criticized before for not effectively monetizing their app. Other messaging apps like the Chinese WeChat or the Korean KakaoTalk have ads and make more revenue per user than WhatsApp does. However this might just be a smart strategic move from WhatsApp to expand first and to gain a customer base as big as possible. Afterwards they'll have a much larger crowd to reach out to and it is easier for them to make more money should they change their policies. Another fun fact: The giant WhatsApp has only **55 employees**.
Allergies make you itchy. Rubbing things that itch makes it feel better. In turn you're rubbing your eyes with something that's probably covered in the stuff your allergic to, Making the irritation worse.
Some automatic guns, typically machine guns, have replaceable barrels that are meant to be interchanged when they overheat. Some older machine guns were even water-cooled, or had rotating barrels that would share the thermal load (i.e. the classic Gatling gun). Otherwise, the barrels are just kept well ventilated so that airflow will cool them off. Most automatic weapons, like assault rifles, aren't really meant to be fired continuously, so overheating isn't much of a problem in normal use.
I'm confused by the question. What do you mean by "standard particle physics"? The Standard Model of particle physics is a relativistic quantum field theory.

The golden rule of the stock market is basically akin to saying that the golden rule of roulette is to always pick the winning number. True, but not very helpful in practice. If you knew exactly what a given stock was going to do in the next 24 hours you could make a fortune on almost any stock. In many cases you could actually do it without any startup money since under the right circumstances you can sell before you have to pay. That's why insider trading is illegal, because even a vague idea of what a stock will do is really powerful. To reuse our roulette example it's like knowing whether a particular roll will be red or black. Not as good as knowing the number, but a hell of a lot better than random.
Most touch screens with a hard surface, like on phones etc, use an effect known as 'capacitive coupling' (hence the name capacitive touch screen) to sense a press. The surface of the panel forms a capacitor with your body and the circuitry senses this. It requires a slightly conductive pointer, hence why a hotdog will work but an insulating pen wont. A resistive touchscreen (they are *slightly* squishy to press) relies on physical pressure, so any pointer will work with them. Then there's infra red touchscreens too, which line up a row of sensors and IR transmitters (like a row of tiny versions of your TV remote) along the edges of the screen and sense your finger blocking the light from travelling from one side to another. They can use anything that isn't transparent to work.
They aren't. Just ask the guy that was just killed for being suspected of eating beef. You just do not hear as much about it.
The very first computers were large mechanical devices which were programmed by flipping a number of switches to various positions to indicate which commands to execute. Later computers were programmed via [punched cards]( URL_1 ). Literal holes were punched in stiff card using a special hole puncher; the pattern of holes represented program instructions, and these cards were then read by the machine and the corresponding instructions executed. The invention of the [Von Neumann architecture]( URL_0 ) is what first allowed programs to be stored in memory alongside data. At first, programs had to be carefully crafted in machine language using something like binary notation. From there, assembly language notation was invented, then higher level programming languages, and the rest is history.
During the Second World War, the U.S. government thought it was a good idea to limit what a company could pay a worker. So, let's pretend your job is making Ninja Turtle action figures in my Ninja Turtle factory. I pay you ten gummy bears an hour for making these Ninja Turtle dolls. Now, I think you're a good worker, so I want to pay you fifteen gummy bears instead of ten. The U.S. government steps in and says, "No! That's not fair. You can only pay ecfunj1 ten gummy bears an hour. That's the law. It's for the greater good- we're in a war, doncha know." Now I, being the staunchly capitalist factory owner that I am, who thinks that you should be paid what you're worth, say, "Well, you're not the boss of me, Federal Government! I think ecfunj1 should get more money." However, not wanting to go to jail, I devise a way around this ridiculous statute. Instead of giving you more money, I pay for your healthcare, which gets around the wage controls set by the government and compensates you more for your labor. Other ways I find to get around this law are paid sick and vacation days. Basically, the reason there is a strong tradition of employer-based healthcare in the United States stems from 1940s government-mandated price and wage controls. Employers who competed in hiring workers in a scarce labor market were unable to pay more money to attract more/better workers. Employers resorted to offering perks, such as health insurance and paid sick/vacation days, to compensate workers more without breaking the law by paying them more. Additionally, there are special tax-deductions in the Tax Code for employer-paid healthcare. Employers are able to reduce their tax burden by providing health insurance to employees, and employees do not report health insurance paid by their employer as income. These special tax privileges reinforced the employer-based health insurance structure that came into existence in the 1940s. Edit: Here's more reading for the economically-curious:  URL_0

Hackers, in the classical sense, are a lot like a good baker. They can work from scratch without directions, know what they're doing and why, and can adapt to different things if they don't get the result they expected. Script kiddies are like someone following a cookie recipe off a bag of chocolate chips. They have to follow the directions exactly and won't know how to fix it if things don't come out right.
You don't usually work on the same files because everything is split up between the departments. I haven't used USD yet but I have encountered the following workflow in different studios (using Maya). For example: a character that has been rigged by one (or more, but not at the same time) rigger goes to the animators. Every animator works with the same character rig BUT each animator works on his/her own shot. He/She references (or "links") the rig into their scene so that any change that is later made to the rig can be updated in the animators' scenes as well. The environment of that scene is usually a rough blockout, done in the modeling department. It contains all the objects the animator needs to set up and let the character act in his/her shot. Then the scene gets switched out with the final scene (with textures, shading, lights and details) and the character rig is often updated as well, to get any dynamic stuff like hair, cloth and the hires render meshes in there. This is often done in separate departments as well, depending on the size of the studio. This is my simple depiction of the process and it varies from studio to studio. I would love to read some more experiences, also about USD, if anyone has worked with it or with a different pipeline.
You ever see those guys along the side of the road with a tripod and a bunch of flags and stakes? They're surveyors. It's their job to make sure things like roads are *exactly* where they are supposed to be. They take sightings, and then do the math. A little trigonometry and a good [theodolite]( URL_0 ) can get you an incredibly exact measurement.
Getting the flu four times a year is abnormal. If you're really getting the flu four times a year, and not exaggerating, then that could be the symptom of something more serious. If you haven't already then you should go see your doctor and discuss this with them.
Since the tiny edges of the grass are rubbing up against you, they usually make small, unnoticeable cuts on your skin, which can cause slight itching. This is usually the case unless you're allergic and are having a reaction. You can read more here:  URL_0  After all, they're called *blades* of grass for a reason. Hope this helped!
I believe Facebook has a reporting option to report deaths. If a family member provides the proper documents they can turn it into a memorial type page. (Or maybe I just dreamed that.)
It's because the nerves responsible for sensation **on your skin (called "dermatomes") look like [this]( URL_0 ). Each one of those lines correspond with a region of the brain that causes sensation. Notice how there are 3 sections in the hands alone, but 3 sections in the entire leg. Your hands need to be much more sensitive, which is why there are more nerves dedicated to those areas than the legs or arms (for example). So when you can't get that itch, it's not that it's *under* the skin, it's that it's in a different area completely. You just can't tell very well, because the nerves aren't as accurate in some areas, and you're just feeling that there is an itch in that general direction instead.
America is the third largest country in the world by population, and the third largest by size. Europe's population is slightly larger, but the United States has a single dominant language and internal free markets and free movement. It has enormous coal deposits as well as significant petroleum and other natural resources. And it is the only major Western power that was not decimated in WWI and WWII. And, it happened to be the wealthiest and most prosperous nation at a time when economic development began to compound on itself via the information revolution.
In areas where speeds are enforced by aircraft, there will be timing marks painted on the roadway. An officer in an aircraft overhead will time cars as they pass between these marks, and if a car crosses the gap in less than the benchmark time, they will radio down to a car waiting on the ground, which will make the stop and issue the ticket. But this is expensive, as it requires at least three officers (two overhead and one on the ground), so it may not be used very often even when the road is set up for it.
I actually knew a guy who did this. A business owner in NYC. Whenever we'd go out (he was my client) he'd just park his BWM anywhere. Street corners, handicap spaces, fire hydrants, whatever. He came out to a ticket every time. He just tossed it in the back and handed it to his assistant when he got to the office. He figures he spent 4 to 5 thousand a year on fines. But he made 2 million. So his parking costs were just 0.25% of his income. One quarter of one percent. Which is basically what you probably pay as a percentage of your yearly income parking legitimately at meters or in garages.
Your immune system is kind of like a highway. There are all sorts of things on the highway to prevent cars from driving recklessly. There are two ways to enforce traffic laws on the highway, physical ~~barriers~~ deterrents and cops. The physical ~~barriers~~ deterrents are your innate immune response, the cops are the adaptive immune response. Histamine is a physical ~~barriers~~ deterrents, in our analogy, let's call it a speed bump. Speed bumps affect all traffic on the highway. If you have speed bumps engaged when you don't need them, like if you are exposed to an allergen such as pollen, it's a hassle for everyone involved. Allergy medicine turns off the speed bumps, but the cops are still around, and there are other physical ~~barriers~~ deterrents still present. EDIT: Changed barriers to deterrents to prevent confusion with the physical barriers used by the human body.
When mummy and daddy get sick of silly pranks pulled by their children they make up rules such as this one.
Some of it is probably the sexualization of women, but some of it is just what the athletes find acceptable and comfortable. Many women already wear tight/ form fitting clothes in their daily lives. Few men do. So it would be unusual for that to flip when it comes to athletic wear. Women commonly wear short shorts. Guys commonly wear baggier shorts. So it's not a surprise that women feel comfortable with short shorts/ tights in athletics. It would be weird if a guy started wearing short tights when he only wears longer, more baggy clothes outside of sport.
Not a monopoly, many high-end and low-end clothing manufacturers have their own zipper production companies. YKK just makes a ton of zippers and have made them for a long time. Same thing as WD40 or GE lightbulbs, they aren't the only company who is allowed to or able to make these products, they just make the most.
If you find yourself exposed to the near vacuum of space, so long as you don’t try to hold your breath, which would result in your lungs rupturing and thus pretty well guaranteed that the incident would be fatal, you’ll likely remain conscious for about 10-15 seconds, with perhaps half that being useful consciousness. After that, you’ll be fine as long as you’re placed back in a pressurized environment within about 90-180 seconds. These numbers are based on both human accidents that have occurred and on experiments run on animals. For instance, in 1965, researchers at the Brooks Air Force Base in Texas ran a series of experiments on dogs. They exposed the dogs to 1/380th normal atmospheric pressure for varying amounts of time to see how the animals’ bodies would react. In most cases, the dogs survived without permanent damage, so long as the time frame was less than 90 seconds. Once they pushed it to two minutes, the dogs typically suffered cardiac arrest and died. So that’s dogs. **What about humans**? Chimpanzees were chosen here as the guinea pigs. They did much better than the dogs, with most able to survive for up to 3 minutes, with the record being 3 and a half minutes. For those under 3 minutes, they not only were fine, but the researchers were able to confirm that their cognitive abilities, with one exception, were not damaged in any way. We don’t just need to rely on animal tests though. One of the first such accidents was when a technician at the Johnson Space Center in 1965 accidentally depressurized his suit by ripping out a hose. He remained conscious for 14 seconds. During this time, he remembered feeling the water rapidly evaporating off his tongue. Around the 15 second mark other technicians started the process of re-pressurizing the chamber. He regained consciousness at around the 15,000 ft. atmospheric pressure level, which was about 27 seconds into the ordeal. The only residual effect noted was that he couldn’t taste anything for several days after the accident, though his sense of taste returned to normal within a week. On the other end of the spectrum we have an incident involving a man who wasn’t so lucky. According to a paper by Dr. Emanuel M. Roth, Rapid Decompression Emergencies in Pressure-Suited Subject, published in 1968, it took about 3 minutes to re-pressurize the chamber the man was in. Once it was re-pressurized, he gasped a few times, then ceased to breathe. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful. So it would appear, much like with the chimpanzees, the **3 minute mark is roughly the upper limit for humans**.
The angered mob was buying and selling shares of stock to one another. The setting for these trades is called the trading floor. The loud shouting was to inform anyone your interest of selling or buying a quantity of stock at a price. Once you find someone to make the trade with, you each fill out a trading slip and the transaction is confirmed. Now, more popularly, the asking and bidding on shares is performed via computers.
Bluntly put, the median lethal dose (LD50) of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) is so high and the methods of intake so dilute that you would have to do absolutely impossible feats to have it occur. While there are a couple of different and conflicting sources, one estimate placed it at 40,000 times as much as the dose needed to get high. This is contrasted with alcohol, where five to ten times the amounted needed to get you drunk can kill you. To extrapolate, With pot brownies you'd die of sugar poisoning long before the THC got you. With smoking, you'd have to smoke something like 1,500 pounds of weed in a period of 15 minutes. To actually manage a THC overdose you'd have to spend a lot of effort to first purify a sizable quantity of THC and then ingest it rapidly. This would never happen accidentally.

The most well known auditory illusion is called a "Shepard tone" which sounds like a pitch continuously increasing or decreasing forever. Made famous by [Super Mario 64 ]( URL_0 )
by -273K you are probably referring to -273 C, which is 0 K. Kelvin is an absolute scale, there is no negative (in the sense of being colder than 0). 0 Kelvin is the absence of heat. (Note, I'm doing some handwaving here, there actually systems that can have a negative kelvin temperature, but these are actually *hotter* than any system with a positive temperature. They are not negative in the sense of being 'colder'.) Part of the confusion of why we can't 'go lower' probably arises from Celsius and Farenheit, which are not absolute scales. Their zero point is arbitrary, and doesn't correspond to some 'minimum.' Hence, going below zero is not a problem for them. The thing to realize however, is that even negative x Farenheit or Negative Y Celsius still has heat present. It's only negative in the sense that *it is below where we decided to put the zero.* The same is not true in Kelvins. 0 is when all of the heat is gone. You can't remove more heat than all of the heat.
Monsanto tends to get into trouble because of their tendency to employ strong arm legal tactics against farmers. Specifically, they patented their seeds, so when you buy seed from Monsanto you're really just buying a license to a plant which will grow and produce its own seeds...but legally you can't plant those seeds because your license doesn't cover them. So if you're a poor farmer in India and Monsanto's people convince you their seed is amazing and will give you a great crop yield, and you fork over all your money to buy their seed but that year your crop fails...now you're broke and you have no useful seed because if you just replant your crops you'll get sued. And that's the best case, if you went into debt for those seeds now you're in the hole money you can't recoup without a harvest, but you can't harvest anything without licensing more plants...or totally reinvesting in seed from somewhere else...that you can't afford because you're in debt. This actually cause a rash of farmer suicides. Also since plants are living things they tend to attempt to reproduce, so if GMO wheat from Monsanto's research farm in Oregon spreads itself and ends up in your organic farm, your certifications are all in trouble. If you're big enough to sell to other states or countries if they don't allow GMO wheat you can't sell to them anymore, your whole business is fucked. This also happened. Finally, if you're a farmer, and your neighbor's a farmer, and he buys Monsanto's seeds but you don't. Some seasons later Monsanto comes over and realizes his crops fertilized your crops and now you're growing hybrid plants through no intent of your own. Technically that's patent infringement and now Monsanto is suing you because the guy next door to you bought their product and then plants did their thing and tried to make more plants.
Any unknown person can do or say things in the name of Anonymous. That's why you basically have to ignore everything Anonymous says they will do, and only look at what they actually do. There's no leadership, but there are I believe certain core groups who know one another by persistent pseudonyms, and may possibly know one another afk. They are probably disproportionately influential, in that they run widely-subscribed youtube/twitter/whatever accounts which play a significant role in getting messages out to the rest of Anonymous, but they aren't leadership in any classical sense of the word.
Are you sure she's not adopted or something...? Maybe it's just because the sound is unpleasant to her. Does she actually run up to the door as if someone is about to walk in?
Slashes and colons are used as part of the *file system*; that is, the thing that tells the computer where to look for a file with that name. The Windows OS has been updated to distinguish between a slash in a filename and a "meaningful" slash, but MS Office has not. Before things like Windows and Macs existed, you had to make a computer do things by just typing commands. Spaces were "meaningful" when you typed in those commands, so it was impossible to have a filename with spaces in it. Because of that, some very old programs cannot handle filenames with spaces.
I can. Am I a mutant? Is this my power?
It's a compromise between hard enough to make a mark that's readable by the machine (machines worked by sensing opaqueness so #3 and #4 weren't always dark enough to be readable) vs not smudging when erased (#1 is darker than #2, but is harder to cleanly erase without creating a bigger smudge patch that could also lead to errors). In truth, the machines have improved with technology and can read most types of marks very accurately, but since #2 remains in the sweet spot (and keeps people from using ink that's much harder to cleanly erase), they still recommend it.
According to the story, the first pizza delivered was to Queen Margherita in Italy in the late 1800's. (Who still has a pizza named after her, the one with tomato, basil, and mozzarella cheese.) Previous to this pizza was considered peasant food. According to the story, she woke up one day and said she was bored with the fancy, expensive food she's always eating and wanted something different. The most renowned pizza chef in the area made the pizza, now called a Margherita pizza, with the colors of the Italian flag and had it delivered to her. The queen declared it delicious, and as is frequently the case everyone wanted to try what the queen had tried and loved: Freshly made pizza delivered to her door. Source:  URL_0 
We do. They're called [dental sealants]( URL_0 ). But, here's the problem: * They can't cover *all* of your teeth. They won't go below the gumline, for example, and the gumline is still a big part of dental health; * They can still wear down just from the process of using your teeth to eat and chew;
The monarch is head of state, as opposed to head of government (that would be the Prime Minister); in European republics, the monarch is usually replaced by a President, who may have more definite powers and is either directly or indirectly elected. The head of state basically represents the country, while the head of government sets the broad agenda for the legislature and also chairs the cabinet. The US President effectively combines the roles of head of state and head of government, which is sometimes problematic in terms of diplomacy: a recent petition (signed by 1.8 million people) called on the government not to accord President Trump the honour of a full state visit due to controversies surrounding his conduct as head of government. In the last few centuries, the role of monarch has declined, and since Victoria has kept out of party politics altogether -- in public, that is. In private, she has regular audiences with the Prime Minister in which they talk of matters of state. In theory, the most important role the British monarch has is to ensure good governance, but it's unclear how much she can actually do to that end. It's also unclear just how much influence she does have on government policy, since the details of her meetings with the PM are confidential. It is known that Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, once complained that if the queen could vote, she would vote Liberal Democrat. The murky nature of her exact role, given that she is unelected and accountable only to constitutional law (whatever that may be on a given day), obviously makes a lot of people nervous. On the other hand, given her very long reign (her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill), her experience may well be extremely useful. Diplomatically, she performs a role that is arguably very important. As head of state, she meets other heads of states, and that certainly helps to oil the complex machinery of international relations. It may be helpful that, since she is a hereditary monarch, she doesn't have to toe the party line or keep one eye on her approval ratings.
Acne is caused by sebaceous glands under the skin that secrete sebum into your pores. I believe there are less glands on your hands and arms which would make zits less likely to occur there. The highest amount of glands are on your face where most acne occurs. Its been a while though since I studied this so someone else should confirm.
Once you build a building more than 3-4 stories tall each additional floor become far more expensive to build/maintain. In some places where space is very scarce it would be more efficient but most places, particularly in the US it is not so they build multiple 2-4 story buildings.
I don't use an iPhone, but my Android has 'emergency contacts' that can be called whilst the phone is locked. Do iPhones have an equivalent of this, that you might have setup in the past and forgotten about?
People who do this say they do it to feel normal. And most of them believe it when they say it. What's actually going on is that the substance they're using dulls the edges in their mind and makes their pain less immediate, less real. For that reason, they come to think that because the substance reduces or eliminates the pain, it makes them "normal" again. That logic has holes in it big enough to drive a truck through, but I've heard the same answer from every addict I've talked with.
For this explanation I'll stick with painting, though it applies to art in general. There's two main things you look at when viewing a painting. It's "form" and its "content." Form describes the physical stuff about a painting: color, size, what type of paint, thickness of paint, type of canvas, type of brush strokes, and so on. Content describes what the painting is depicting: a house, a person, a group of people, a particular event, a collection of objects, whatever. We'll look at two paintings, one "normal" painting and then an abstract one. First up is [Leutze's painting of Washington crossing the Deleware.]( URL_0 ) What are its formal qualities? Well, it's really big, 21 feet long. It's painted in oil paint using brush strokes that aren't really visible unless you're right up close. The colors are natural and a little muted. It's a horizontal rectangle. It's probably very heavy. And I assume it's made out of wood and canvas. Other than the size, there's not much going on as far as form goes. But as far as content is concerned, well... I'll just link you to the [wikipedia article.]( URL_1 ) There's a whole story being told in the piece. There's men in boats, there's a great general, there's an icy river and terrified horses. There's content out the wazoo. **This is the point of most "normal" painting**:to depict something, and do it in such a way that the viewer isn't really worried about the how it's painted or the formal elements. It's like when you watch TV, you don't think about all the transistors and LEDs that make the thing function, you just watch your show. Now on to the abstract piece, [Jackson Pollok's Autumn Rhythm No. 30.]( URL_2 ) Where "normal" painting is all about content, abstract painting is all about form. This painting is 17 feet long. The paint is thick and applied with a crazy dripping, splattering technique. The canvas is left bare in many places; you can see what its made out of. As far as content goes, there is literally none. The entire point of this painting is the form, how the paint is applied to the canvas. In the absence of any kind of content the viewer is left to simply react to the painting however they'd like. There are no politics in Autumn Rhythm, no story, no reclining nudes, no faces--no content. Going back to the TV metephor: It'd be like if somebody broke your TV down into it's individual components and spread them out on the floor. It's no longer about what it's displaying, it's about what makes the TV work, and what it's made of. Why is abstract art important? Because it's progressive. Since the beginning of civilization most, if not all art was representational. Cavemen painted pictures of mammoth hunts and fertility goddesses on their cave walls, and up until very recently all that anyone in history could really do was paint that hunt a little more realistically. In the twentieth century (arguably a little bit earlier) artists deliberately moved away from representational art and simply tried to capture their feeling of a time and a place. This acceptance of emotion by itself, not attached to any concrete meaning is the essence of the abstract, and reflects a growth in the consciousness of humanity as a species. We're no longer just goofballs staring at the TV, watching whatever is on. We've taken it apart and now we're learning about electricity and transistors and LEDs and wires and the specifics of what makes the whole thing work. So to answer your question: you should appreciate abstract art because of it's formal qualities. Look at the brush strokes. Look at the colors. Look at the size and shape of the work. Ask yourself why the artist made the decisions they made. Think about the feeling the artist was trying to communicate. Think about your own feelings while you look at an abstract piece of work. Is it uplifting? Depressing?Energizing? Chaotic? Orderly? And you should appreciate abstract art because of what it means as a milestone in the grand endevor of human expression. I should add that little reproductions of these works on your computer screen don't compare to the seeing the real deal. **Go out and see art.** edit: formatting
So, the question is why people try things that are bad for them, even if they feel good? Do you ever drink soda? what about eating fast food? drinking alcohol? they're a lesser extent, but you must be totally aware that's not good for your body. But you make excuses, "oh only this one time", "it cant be THAT bad for you", etc etc, but the fact remains you're doing something bad for you to feel good.
We're drinking up our groundwater, as well as shipping it in from other areas like the Colorado River. None of this is sustainable, and something major has to give eventually, but most of our smaller-scale government doesn't really want to talk or think about it much. Our state government will, but only because they have to, and even then in minimal amounts. There's a perception I think that rabble rousing about the drought is political suicide, even if that's the only thing that'll save us from running out of water. The sad thing is, that's not entirely unfounded - last time we rationed water, people got *angry*, and incumbents lost.
There aren't any forces acting on your body that would make you feel that way, except for when you are accelerating to/from that speed. Every part of the airplane -- your seat, the floor, the air in the cabin -- is moving at the same speed as you are, so there is no way for your body to tell.
There is no such thing as an ‘antinutrient’. Also, don’t ever listen to anyone who uses the word ‘toxin’.
Steak needs to be matured without moisture. This is done either by hanging it in a dry room (the traditional way of doing it, but time consuming), or in a vacuum-sealed bag (quicker, and more common). [Source]( URL_0 ). When you keep steak at home, you can't control the atmosphere the way it's controlled by the producer. Because of this, it will go off much sooner.
Bees don't reproduce very quickly. You can't just "breed more" because it would take a while. It would also not solve the underlying problems, so you would have a lot of bees and then you would go to having very few bees very quickly.
Actual opera singer here. The same reason why anyone gains weight when they are in a high-stress job that requires a lot of travel. It's a stressful job with intense hours during production periods, and it gets really easy to neglect exercise and just eat crappy foods, especially because you usually celebrate after performances with your friends/colleagues/family. You often don't get a lot of sleep, and that can also mess with your overall health. As far as actual singing goes, there's actually no evidence that being overweight makes your voice bigger, lets you sing louder/over an orchestra, or anything like that at all. If anything, vocal scientists are finding that being in better physical shape actually IMPROVES vocal stamina and quality, just as being in shape improves performance in any physical activity. HOWEVER, being fat has some "advantages" when learning to sing classically. Some of the most common phrases to singers is that they need "to be grounded," "sing from their diaphragm", "have low-breath," etc. When you're carrying around a lot of extra belly weight, you have a constant tugging-down feeling. You have extra weight physically pulling the breath mechanism downwards. It can help in learning to sing. Also, until recently, it didn't matter if you were fat and unhealthy. If you had a god-like voice, you could look however you want and still perform and get good work. Opera used to be (and, IMO, SHOULD still be) about the voice and music over anything else. Now that there is a big push for opera singers to LOOK like the roles they play (nobody wants to see a 300 lb Juliet anymore), many professional singers have taken to losing weight in unhealthy, crash diets. They lose weight so quickly, they are unable to feel the changes that happen in their body and take time to make proper adjustments. They no longer feel "grounded" because they don't have the weight actually "grounding" them. So their technique suffers, their voice gets "lighter", they have an existential crisis, say they can only sing when at a certain weight, and eat themselves into oblivion again. Those who lose weight responsibly and healthily rarely, if ever, have any problems singing. **TL;DR It's a big, mental game. Some singers think they can only sing at a certain weight and size, and actively try to stay large.**
In the US there is an organization called the "FCC" or the Federal Communications Commission which regulates the frequencies which wireless devices can employ in order to prevent such interference and failures. Other countries have similar bodies.
Mr. El Niño is especially angry this year and there's a meandering jet stream bringing up warm wet air across the eastern US. Expect the entire winter to be wet and mild. I imagine some wet snow in January/February once the cold really does set in a bit more and we get those days that range around 30 - 40. Basically think of this as nothing more than a warm front coming through what is already going to be a mild winter due to El Niño. Soon enough the cold front will arrive and we'll have our days about 30 degrees colder lol.
Second hand knowledge here: a friend was fluent in three languages and told me that when he thinks, they all blend together, but it still makes sense to him.
Sand dunes buried most of them. All the ancient Egyptians were dead by then and the area wasn't that populated, so people lost track of where they all were. Sometimes the wind blows the sand away, and poof, there is the top of a pyramid.
Because the alcohol industry is better at Public Relations management. Tobacco has become the public whipping boy and the slightest breath to defend tobacco will draw an insane firestorm of rabid mouth-foamers (despite whatever huge chunk of society is stupid enough to choose smoking). The fact that "plain packaging" - which really shows diseased eyeballs and rotting teeth and such -- can be mandated for cigs is a clear example. Try to push that on anything else bad, alcohol, whatever, and you'd see people freak out. Bashing tobacco is the media darling these days and there is no limit to how far you can push that.
Yes, and no. Intelligence isn't really something that exists by itself, its more a combination of curiosity, creativity, persistence, experience, memory, and calculation. Those are to different degrees innate or trained/learned skills. Regardless of how smart you are it's damn hard to learn something you find dreadfully boring, and extremely easy to learn something you find fascinating. Though you often need some pretty significant persistence in learning the boring stuff so you have the required foundation to understand the interesting stuff. As for genetics. Mental strength is a lot like physical strength. You aren't going to win a gold medal at the olympics without both innate talent and a ton of hard work and training. Yet a puny weakling can obtain significant strength through exercise and training.
They have private bathrooms and while the station isn't big there are not constantly people around every square inch of it. However I don't think they get special jerk-off time they can probably find private time in the bathroom or in their bunk. Of course it is space so you have to take extra precautions for anything that might go flying off and float around.
It prevented the Allies from landing tanks on the beach and advancing upon the gun positions.
It is not the amount of volume. It is the pressures inside your blood vessels...and therefore your organs. Blood letting would not cure hypertension. It might lower your blood pressure do to hypovolemia (loss of volume) for a period of time, but when your body recovers you will still have hypertension. And those damaging pressures on your organs, kidneys and brain specifically.
Our eyes do not operate well in low light. Our hunting skills are sight based. So over-all going hunting in anything but daylight means we're more likely to be the prey, then the hunter. We weren't the top predator back when we were evolving, we used progressively better tools to drag our way up the list.
Originally the mesh was used as a lightweight barrier to block men's wee-wee's from direct contract from the fabric of the actual boardshorts. When the cloth got wet it got heavier and would cause your sensitive bits to chafe and that's very uncomfortable. More and more companies are starting to make boardshorts without the mesh now, however. They are able to do this because of the inventions of micro-fibers and quick drying technology. There's also a new stitch pattern called "flat-lock" stitching which is a non-abrasive stitch used a lot now in active wear clothing. You'll see it a lot in Nike and Under Armour. Source: Worked for both Under Armour and Hurley for several years. EDIT: The underwear underneath the boardshorts seems to have some mixed opinions from what I've read. I personally wear Hurley Phantom boardshorts without any underwear on and there is no chaffing issue. The only downside that I PERSONALLY see about wearing underwear underneath is that it takes longer for you to dry completely. I don't believe only douches wear underwear and I don't think it's a weird decision. It's all about comfort.
Highly vinegared pickles are traditionally served with meats that have a high fat content. The vinegar cuts through the rich, heavy taste of the fat, balancing the whole thing. These days not all sandwiches use fatty meats, but that is how the tradition started: the pickle as pleasant counter to the fatty meat in the sandwich.
As a local shop owner, when people buy from me, it means I (your neighbor), get your money, not an investor to Caribou Coffee. I, the only guy who works here, can afford to feed my family. I'm not a corporation that has 1000 stores and paying overhead on 1000 stores. That money you give me goes to the electric company, the restaurant where we celebrate after the Sport Team wins, and the local farmers market. I'm buying my produce from the guy who lives down the street...his tomatoes came in great this year. He's also got a daughter in college. I helped him pay his bills this month, and when she graduates, she's gonna run a B & B, which means more people are gonna drop the town and have a cup of coffee.
The cemetery has to put some money for each burial into a perpetual care fund. This money is invested and used to pay for the ongoing maintenance of the cemetery. Some cemeteries are publicly funded by taxes.
Some people like living on a street with no through traffic. It's very inconvenient, but they like the quiet.
Laws differ by country, so my answer applies to the United States... In general, if a person is in a place where they don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy (street, shopping center, etc.) you are allowed to take their picture and publish it (newspaper, tv, Internet, etc.) if it's in the public interest. For example, if you are walking down the street on a hot day and I take a picture of you wiping sweat off your brow I can publish the picture in the newspaper, without your permission, to illustrate an article about the hot weather. However, I can not use that picture in an advertisement for sunscreen (or anything else for that matter) without your permission. There are exceptions to this rule that protect people from libel and invasion of privacy, but there's no law requiring news organizations from blurring out faces.
I would say the most accurate answer is we don't know why we can't. If we knew why we can't, we'd probably know why we can. (Imagine asking preflight engineers why we can't fly or preantibiotic doctors why we can't cure infection) Firstly, some incorrect answers in the thread can lead us to an OK answer. That laser business is completely useless in my opinion. But the mechanism will explain why we can't do the same for enamel. Those lasers work by chemically treating and then stimulating odontoblasts (cells which create dentine, the second layer of the tooth, enamels softer little brother) to create dentine. I won't go too far into why the only reason those lasers are gaining traction is because they're lasers, but long story short is you need vital, sterile, exposed pulp tissue, which really is only found in the case of trauma. But we already know how to stimulate dentine in such situations - CaOH or MTA. Anyone interested in why this 'breakthrough' is literally nothing but a waste of money for both clinician and patient, please Google 'Cvek Pulpotomy'. We have been doing this for decades. Now, onto the question - why can't we do that with enamel? Consider how teeth are formed. An ELIcloserto5 version, is teeth are made of 3 layers like a cake. The crisp, hard, protective, water tight icing (enamel), the softer, porous, shock absorbing sponge cake (dentine), and the gelatinous jam (blood) and cream (nerve) inner filling. The critical part here, is how the icing and sponge are formed. The icing creating cells (ameloblasts) and the sponge creating cells (odontoblasts) start touching each other. Then, step by step, nanometer by nanometer, they move away from eachother, laying down icing and sponge cake as they go. The sponge cake cells move towards the jam and cream fillig, and when they are done they live in the filling, laying down sponge when stimulated for the life of the tooth.The icing cells move away from the jam cream filling, to the harsh outside world. Eventually, when the cake leaves the oven, the icing creating cells are lost. Now, the world is harsh. The outside world is full of flies and general trauma, which will wear the icing down and lose sugar (minerals from hydroxapatite - calcium and phosphate, although fluoride can go back in as an even better/harder mineral, though not naturally present). With good diligence shooing the flies away (brushing/flossing) and regular reintroduction of lost sugar (toothpaste/fluoride/that gum someone mentioned) we can replace the lost sugar. However, sugar isn't icing - some specialised cells laid down the sugar in a very particular way. As long as not to much sugar is lost and no big chunks are missing, just dusting it with sugar will work, as the exisitng icing holds enough of the pattern that there's only one way for the dusted sugar to go - the right way. We know what's in the icing - we have the recipe. But we can't lay it down with the same style and pattern the cells did. And the cells are lost. There's no stimulating them like the sponge cells. Once the icing is gone, it's gone. Edit: the comments in this thread are a testament to what I'm saying about lasers. People are almost satirical in their irrational affinity towards the study, simply because "lasers".
Actually [eyewitness testimony]( URL_0 ) isn't all that reliable.  > Mistaken or flawed identification has assumed a newfound prominence in recent years: It's been cited as a factor in nearly 78 percent of the nation's first 130 convictions later overturned by DNA testing, according to the New York-based Innocence Project, which works to free the wrongly convicted. As a result, a number of researchers are turning their attention to helping police departments and juries better understand the circumstances under which eyewitnesses observe crimes and later identify a suspect
There are two things at work that would make it a good idea for your body to close its eyes for sleep. The first being that during the day we are constantly blinking to lubricate and moisten our eyes. At night, keeping your eyes closed protects them from drying out and getting irritation and from building up mucus in the eye ducts. The second has to do with a chemical known as melatonin. Melatonin is dependent upon the light and dark rhythms around your body. When it is nighttime and the light around you begins to disappear, your body begins to produce melatonin which is a signal to your brain that it is time to sleep. The darker it is, the more melatonin your body will produce. Once it lightens again, your body stops producing melatonin and it signals your brain again that it is time to awaken. It is best for your body to close its eyes so that they can sense as little light as possible, produce more melatonin and thereby convince your brain to sleep.
Marriage is a legal contract between two people regarding property rights, debts, affairs of the spouse should the spouse become incapacitated and guardianship of children. Marriage laws are necessary to manage how these are played out in a jurisdiction.
You are "looking into the past" whenever you look at *anything*. Sure, that star is 5 million light years away, so what you're seeing is as it was 5 million years ago. The sun is ~8 light minutes away. You're seeing it as it was 8 minutes ago. The moon? ~2 seconds. Your monitor? A very tiny amount, but more than zero. Edit: As an addendum: the stars you generally see in the sky are not as far as 5M light years. Our galaxy is only about 100 000 light years in diameter.
Animals rape each other in the wild, does that justify rape? Basing your morality off of what wild animals do isn't sound logic.
Thank you all for the answers. Sadly this 30 min test basically told it's time put down my dog. I'll be crying in my room if you need me. EDIT: I'll add on to this so hopefully more see this, took her to the vet and turns out it was really bad case of [DKA]( URL_0 ). All the symptoms she had we assumed she was just getting slower with old age. She pulled through today and has another big day ahead of her tomorrow. If the levels fall she'll make it and we will do insulin the rest of her days, if not.... Basically don't be a cheapo like me and do the blood work at the yearly check ups. It's worth it and I feel like the worst human ever for not doing it.
Afghanistan was one of the stages the cold war was fought on. The US and the soviet union both toppled their government like 4 times in the last hundred years. Largely by alternating funding rebel groups. Having no stable government and a long history of well funded terrorism ended up not vanishing when the cold war ended (and we once again toppled and replaced their government which I bet in 5 years will end up getting toppled again by russia backed syrians or something just to keep up the tradition)
The [Rosetta Stone]( URL_0 ) was instrumental. Since it had the same text written in three different languages it essentially handed us a partial translation of Egyptian to Greek.
Being a Nazi, displaying Nazi symbols, etc is illegal in Germany. He is not a hero. There are no streets named after Adolf Hitler, no suburbs, etc. However, there is a Stauffenbergstrasse. The criticism in Germany over the film was due to casting, especially Tom Cruise, who they thought played the role as too American.
I have eczema and my husband is a dermatologist. I have made him explain eczema to me multiple times. This is what I have learned. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a skin barrier function problem. The skin is supposed to keep stuff out- think of a slice of cheddar cheese. People withe eczema are born with skin like Swiss cheese. Stuff gets in more easily and moisture gets out more easily than normal skin. Because things get into the skin, the immune system responds to them as foreign objects- you get inflammation that makes you itch. You scratch the itchy spot and you get more skin breakdown from the trauma. Often the eczema patches are areas of friction- elbows and knees. Eczema treatments revolve around moisturizing to add a layer of protection from allergens getting in. Or topical steroids that decrease inflammation. I get UVB phototherapy. It kills immune system cells (lymphocytes) in the skin surface. The allergens still get into my skin but I have less lymphocytes to catch the allergens and cause inflammation which decreases the amount of itching that I have. The only way to permanently cure eczema would be to permanently improve skin barrier function. Since it is a genetic problem, some researchers are working on gene therapy trials that would change the skin cells to work correctly. The reason many childhood eczema sufferers improve is that skin naturally thickens as you become an adult and it overwhelms the problem. Some people aren't so lucky. Also, people with eczema are more likely to have asthma (allergens get into the skin first and you develop an immune sensitization to the allergen. When you breathe in the same allergen your body sees it as something to fight so you get inflammation and bronchorestriction in the lungs - this is asthma). If you could fix the skin at birth, you would not get the allergens getting into the skin. There would be no inflammation and no itch. We can't do that yet do we target inflammation with immune suppressing drugs like tacrolimus or topical steroids. Moisturizer helps too by improving skin barrier. Right now I have eczema on my eyelids (thin skin), left wrist (friction from watch), hands (loss of natural oils from washing my hands all of the time), both inner elbows and back of knees (areas of friction) and armpits (from clothes rubbing against my skin).
In most European countries the overall length of a truck is limited to less than 20 meters. So the American way of building a truck would cost around 10% of the maximum length to put the engine in front of the drivers seat. European trucks put the driver on top of the engine and so can have longer lorries. The disadvantage is that service of the engine is more complicated because you have to tilt the driver's cabin in order to get to the engine. There's not so much difference regarding the ability to sleep in the vehicle or the size of the engines. The engines of modern Mercedes Actros are quite similar in displacement (11-15l) and power (400-500 HP) to the Mack MP7 and MP8 engines.
English has become common a language used in commerce transportation and science across the world. When a Spanish pilot tries to land on a French Airport they will talk English with the air-traffic control for example. English is often used as a Lingua Franca, a language used by two people who don't share the same native tongue to communicate with one another. Other languages were used for that purpose in the past usually the ones of the great empires and traders. English is just the last in a long row of languages used for this purpose that thanks to the British colonial efforts followed by the rise of its former north American colony to superpower status in the 20th century was predominant just in time for the development of global communication networks to make it *the* language everyone used to communicate with one another. It probably helps that English is as languages go rather easy to learn for many people. Everyone who has conquered parts of the British isle over the last few millennia has left parts of their own language in the mix that the natives spoke and once they started conquering of their own they imported vocabulary back home from whoever they encountered. They also dropped all the hard and complicated grammar stuff that the original languages had making it a very 'simplified' language.
The old-school way was to actually burn it and see how much heat it produced: a calorie is an actual measure of energy. Nowadays, the food would be blended up and analyzed for the amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrate and alcohol (the stuff you can get energy/calories from), and knowing the amount of calories in each of those by weight, they just calculate how many calories it should have. The advantage here is that they can differentiate between calories your body will use, and calories it won't (like that in fiber: it'll burn, but our bodies don't digest it).
Europe is in the center. Since most maps were created in europe (America was not discovered yet, there was an "europlean cluster" and an "asian cluster" of influence) during history, it became "common" in the european (and then american, since it was discovered by europeans) "tradition". If you look at japanese or chinese (or russian) maps they are asian-centric for example.
 > Disc and disk are two variants of the English word for objects of a generally thin and cylindrical geometry. The differences in spelling correspond both with regional differences and with different senses of the word. For example, in the case of flat, rotational data storage media the convention is that the spelling disk is used for magnetic storage (e.g. hard disks) while disc is used for optical storage (e.g. compact discs, better known as CDs). When there is no clear convention, the spelling disk is more popular in American English, while the spelling disc is more popular in British English.
It's standard imperial measurement. 1 cup=1/2 pint (8 oz.) 1/2 cup= 4 oz. 1/4 cup= 2 oz. 1/8 cup= 1 tablespoon Many measuring cups in the US are glass, and have both imperial and metric measurements marked. Funnily enough, I've gotten used to the metric measurement because I'm left handed, and the metric measurements are on what would be the "opposite" side for a right handed pourer.
I think so far the responses in this thread are sort of sugar-coating it. - Of course they did eat very pure plants - Sure, they got protein from eating meat But, you should take a step back and realize that in fact, MOST people suffered: - FUCKTONS of people starved to death, or walked around with serious nutritional deficiencies. - They ate animals that were in atrocious conditions. If you haven't eaten in 5 days and you come across a decomposing deer, you might just go ahead and try to pick out some fresher parts. Even if you hunted and killed a fresh animal, you have no idea what kind of diseases or toxins that animal may be carrying, and could ingest something awful. - Furthermore, some peoples didn't live in temperate, plentiful regions. These people took what they could get. - A fair proportion of people probably had one or more skin or tissue conditions, that is until they couldn't keep up and were left behind; or until they got so infected and nasty that they died of it. - People were small because they didn't eat much and didn't have adequate nutrition. So, really, most humans were *at least* a little fucked up by malnutrition. Aches, pains, disorders, etc. And vast sums of people died directly or indirectly from malnutrition. But the brilliant thing about the continuation of a species is that you don't have to have that many of your species survive to keep on going. As long as the strongest/luckiest among us survive, we can keep multiplying at a pretty steady rate. This is why population graphs tend [to look like this]( URL_0 ); in older times, we made a much steadier march in population growth. It's not a coincidence that the population started exploding once we got a handle on medicine and sanitation.
The chances of you needing a seatbelt in a bus are far less than in a VW bug. The weight and size of a bus makes it inherently safer to drive in than a smaller vehicle. The only problem here is if the bus flips. Then you're fucked.
Only people who fly the confederate flag think it's appropriate. The rest of us go "Ah, you're one of them" and then sit somewhere else.

First of all it has been ranked the worlds 3rd most safest country as of last year. Since it boasts the safe and secure environment, you can freely move around, explore the bush, climb mountains, play, picnic, catch the public transports, discover the beaches or enjoy anything to your heart’s content without any fear. Also NZ is widely accepting of cultures and foreigners that are not in tune with their own.
I just use it as an estimation symbol. "I had the busy shift but I made ~200 bucks in tips."
1.) It fundamentally changed the relationship between the federal government and the individual citizen. This was discussed at length during the Supreme Court hearing (by Kennedy, I believe), pointing out that the government had never claimed the power to force individuals into engaging in commerce with other private parties under penalty of law. 2.) It was a windfall for the very insurance industry that was villainized during its passage. You would be hard-pressed to think of a better way to enrich the Insurance companies while doing very little to address the underlying issues with the cost of healthcare. 3.) It is detrimental to a significant portion of young working families by either forcing them to buy insurance at a time when it is reasonable to forego it due to low risks or to buy it at higher premiums. 4.) The law was huge and complicated, but passed in a rushed, opaque manner at a time when the Democrats had a near supermajority in Congress. It really felt like they were trying to slip something by before anyone had a chance to fully analyze it, leading to a very difficult implementation. The law was rapidly written in a piecemeal fashion by multiple parties, leading to contradictory language and badly in need of a streamlined approach. 5.) It failed to remove long-standing and important barriers to insurance access such as the an on interstate purchase of insurance. This a particularly egregious example of congressional overreach based on the Commerce clause of the Constitution. Congress simultaneously bans interstate commerce on insurance and claims the right to regulate it as interstate commerce. 6.) It is the worst of all solutions. It is neither the relatively simplified and easily regulated single payer solution nor the fully competitive free market solution (I.e. removing barriers like in number 5), but with arguably some of the worst elements of both. I could g on, but I hope this at least shows that it's not all partisan vitriol spewed by puppets of the almighty Fox News clown show as some claim.
Because USB protocol follows master-slave convention. One device is "ruling" USB bus and other devices must follow. If you connect two computers that way, both would want to be "masters". There is also electrical problem, because both PC are providing power to 5V lines. If that circuitry is badly designed it could just fail when there is voltage from the other side present. There are however special USB cables designed exactly for data transfer. They act like external network card.
Pot smoke is, per unit volume, actually more dangerous than tobacco smoke. However, the average tobacco smoker smokes a pack a day, and anyone who is smoking 20 joints per day on average has much bigger problems than bad lungs.
Nuclear energy has really, really, bad PR. Between the population associating destructive forces like nuclear weapons with nuclear power, and the high profile nuclear power incidents that have happened in the past (namely, Chernobyl, 3 Mile Island, and more recently Fukushima) what people think of isn't clean, efficient, safe power. They think of large scale widespread disasters, cities vaporized, and everyone getting cancer. People point out that, for instance, with Fukushima, iirc no one directly died as a consequence, pretty phenomenal safety given the magnitude of the disaster. People point out that coal power plants emit radiation that likely contributes to far more cancer related deaths. But ultimately, the Nuclear side doesn't have the PR power to fight against our fearful imaginings, and quite possibly the PR power of competing interests who like to keep us afraid of it.
The People's Republic of China has been most communist in name only. It is communist only in the sense of how the political party functions, and has had no responsibility to redistribute wealth since the 1990's. China has a capitalist economy that is state-driven, as opposed to the market-driven economies of the West.
Summarised: * iOS users had Google Maps, undoubtedly the best mapping solution, due in part to things like street view, transit directions, consistent maps, etc. * Apple (in their continuing "get Google off iOS" mission) removed Google Maps, and users had to use Apple's mapping system. * The mapping system has every error possible. Cities moved, missing features, incorrect information. [This] ( URL_0 ) tumblr will help explain some of the issues. Also, it shows very clearly to the average consumer something the tech world has known for years: Apple will reduce the user experience for company interests. **** Edit: Apple Maps is *okay* in the US. Not as good as Google Maps, but perhaps useable by those that don't use public transport. Outside of the US, it's terrible.

Film distributors want to have meticulous control over the contents, price, and release dates of their DVDs in various regions of the world. This helps them maximize profits.
I think most people here are forgetting that lotteries are not pure mathematical constructs. It is a game built by, and manipulated by people. Yes, the Gambler's Fallacy suggests that all thing are equal in an equal game, but the game is rarely equal. Firstly, saying that the odds are the same assumes that each lottery ball is built evenly. It is very possible some balls weigh more than others, changing how likely they are of being picked. In this example, it is possible that the No.3 ball is the lightest ball, and more likely to fly to top and be picked. Also, it's possible that when they put the balls in the machine, they do so numerical order. This might make lower numbers more likely to surface than the higher numbers. Secondly, some lotteries are fixed. Intentionally using balls of different weights and sizes make more numbers more likely to appear. In some draws, people heat the key balls up so that someone picked them by hand could identify them. For whatever reason, No. 3 could intentionally chosen more often, maybe because the mob boss' son was born in March. The classic example of the Gambler's fallacy took place in Monte Carlo when the ball landed on black 26 times in a row. A lot people lost money because they kept betting on red, think falsely that there is no way that a ball would land on the same spot for as long as it did. Myself, I would have bet on black, because at that point, I would suspect that the mechanism helping the ball land on black was jammed or something, causing the ball the land on black over and over again. For those that doubt me, [something like this happened in a casino in Montreal]( URL_0 ). To summarize, the casino reset their Keno machines every morning, so their sequence of numbers repeated each day. Somebody figured this out and won $600,000
You can see the Coriolis effect happen IRL by using a Merry-Go-Round at your local playground. You need 2 people and a tennis ball. Get the merry go round going, both of you get on and throw the ball back and forth. It's pretty impossible to catch.
For upper classes, someone would stay up all night with the purpose of waking people up in the morning. They would wake up servants who would in turn wake up their masters. The waker-uppers would go to bed and be woken up in the evening by other servants.
The earth is actually still heating itself. We're not just a bunch of rock, the core and mantle actually have atoms breaking down, releasing heat. We are effectively sat on a nuclear reactor set to slow. Early earth was hotter, and has lost a LOT of heat over time, but the amount we have left isn't just here form the start, our planet is effectively burning fuel to keep active.
Because bacteria love moist, delicious meat. So if you leave a steak or some hamburger in the fridge for more than a few days, they'll have time to eat and grow all over your food. But bacteria need moisture in them to survive, and dry, salted beef doesn't have much. And even more importantly, the salt will actually pull water *out* of bacteria cells, shriveling them up and killing them. Which is why salting has been one of our best preservation methods for thousands of years.
Your body does have internal regulation mechanisms, I'm not a doctor and there are plenty who are who can talk more intelligently about the circadian rhythm of the body etc. The other component is psychological. What's happening is an example of confirmation bias. You've woken up a few times almost on the clock (relative to the total number of days you've ever slept in your life). Though this number is astronomical low, you only remember the times you did wake up on the minute. You bias yourself to count those times and subconsciously ignore the other times and thus you feel as though you have an ability to wake up on time. This also happens when people think that they can catch when people are looking at them. You sometimes do and sometimes don't, but the times you don't are not out of the ordinary so you forget them. Thus you only remember catching them and get a false sense of confirmation.
In a nuclear fission reaction, heavy elements split to released energy. So, 1. Fat Man and Little Boy ~~each had about 60ish kilograms~~ had 10 Kg and 60ish kg respectively of Plutonium or Uranium, Chernobyl had tons of Uranium. 2. Fat Man and Little Boy were both very inefficient. The nuclear fuel within the bombs and the reactors is not dangerously radioactive, the byproducts of the fission reaction are. Both Fat Man and Little Boy only converted a tiny part of their fuel (if I remember correctly, about a kilogram each). A nuclear reactor tends to be far more efficient because it converts constantly rather than a single moment as what happens in a fission bomb, and this combined with the massive amount of nuclear fuel released a massive amount of these fission byproducts. 3. Chernobyl was not a nuclear explosion, it was a steam explosion which flung around radioactive fallout. A nuclear explosion is far bigger and flings it far further, wider, and thinner coverage.
One I can finally answer! A lot of misinformation already in this thread about why the delay happens... I work for a major credit card company and it's my job to find a way to get payments done faster. The major hold up is the amount of time it takes to process so many transactions and the methods that we use (here in the US it's ACH - Automated Clearing House and Direct Credit) aren't the best. Any payment made via ACH has to clear the Federal Reserve System as well and their process only runs once per day. Direct Credit methods should be better since they eliminate that step, but the difference in communication tools, the times at when the banks run their "processing streams," and the sheer volume of transfers all clog up the direct credit system. TL;DR - 2 methods to get payments. 1 has to go through the government and the other is like two people trying to have a conversation by writing letters back and forth in a foreign language at different times. Edit1: I can't go into details about how we and/or banks are fixing this because it's all proprietary stuff, but be assured that it's getting better. I'm really good at what I do and I'm not some greedy person looking to help my company capitalize on "float" capital like so many people are saying below. I'm pushing my company to give up float and they agree. We are now trying to get banks on board and they are coming around to our new solutions. I promise, it'll be faster and faster as time goes on.
There are now 3 domains, eukarya, archaea and bacteria. Eukarya covers plants and animals Archaea covers a group of unicellular microorganisms Bacteria covers a large group of unicellular microorganisms that have no nucleus A fourth would have to be something that does not fit into those 3  &  I can't imagine what that would be.

They do. In America, the data is fed through the FAA and then released on a delay (about 2-3 minutes).

If you love planes like I do, you will get addicted to this website...

No one wants to say it, but I will. African Americans in the United States are descendants of a 14+ generation selective breeding program to build big, strong, humans that would be better farm workers. The effects of this still exist today.
It's a metabolic response. Sort of like adrenalin. Blood rushes to the skin of your body, making you warm. And the blood is red, making you reddish. increasing blood to your head/skin helps you to physically move muscles in the area. For example, If you're scared shitless or cry, the same thing can happen, so blood moves to an area where it feels you need it. In this case, facial expressions/responses. I always think of animals when I think of this, and how they try to chase other animals away by making scary faces when they're scared. It's unneeded for us, but evolutionary.  URL_0

Assume that we're talking about a body of water where the air temperature is constantly below freezing. The important thing to know is that is that water is MOST dense at about 4 degrees C. The reason for this has to do with the shape of the water molecule, but that's not necessary to answer the question. As water gets colder, approaching this temperature, it tends to sink, so the water at the bottom of, say, a big lake, is going to be that temperature. Once the whole lake is 4 degrees, the top starts to go below 4 C where the density starts to decrease again because of crystallization and becomes less dense than liquid water at any temperature. Hence, it floats. But it also creates a thermal barrier, so it's harder for more ice to form. Hope this helps!
We don't know. One theory is that it's a way of testing blood types/immune systems - someone with a more compatible blood type or immune system will "taste" better than someone whose blood type will cause reproductive issues. Some say it's a bonding exercise, that because it involves gazing into each other's eyes for lengthy periods of time along with extreme trust (closing of eyes and shoving a tongue into someone else's tooth-masher is a pretty trusting thing) and as such will further cement the relationship between the two. Some say we humans just like shoving our whatevers into whatever hole we can find. Bonobos also kiss. But then, they fuck as a handshake or because they get bored, so there's that.
Small insurance brokers are "underwritten" by larger ones such as Lloyds of London, and may also have sold some of the risk to other insurers (a practice called reinsurance) such as Swiss Re. Lloyds of London is actually an insurance *market*: they don't carry the risk themselves, that falls on investors (individual and corporate) who make money in good times and lose money in bad times.

I don't know about the "causing inflammation more often" part, but the fingers are specifically chock-full of receptors for stimuli. Fingertips are one of the most touch-sensitive parts of the body. This is why fingertips and nails are used as a specific form of torture, as well. They hurt a lot because there are a lot of receptors there, including for pain.
The Egyptians subdivided daytime and nighttime into twelve hours each since at least 2000 BC, hence the seasonal variation of their hours. The Hellenistic astronomers Hipparchus (c. 150 BC) and Ptolemy (c. AD 150) subdivided the day sexagesimally and also used a mean hour (1⁄24 day), simple fractions of an hour (1⁄4, 2⁄3, etc.) and time-degrees (1⁄360 day or four modern minutes), but not modern minutes or seconds.[8] The day was subdivided sexagesimally, that is by 1⁄60, by 1⁄60 of that, by 1⁄60 of that, etc., to at least six places after the sexagesimal point (a precision of better than 2 microseconds) by the Babylonians after 300 BC. For example, six fractional sexagesimal places of a day was used in their specification of the length of the year, although they were unable to measure such a small fraction of a day in real time. As another example, they specified that the mean synodic month was 29;31,50,8,20 days (four fractional sexagesimal positions), which was repeated by Hipparchus and Ptolemy sexagesimally, and is currently the mean synodic month of the Hebrew calendar, though restated as 29 days 12 hours 793 halakim (where 1 hour = 1080 halakim).[9] The Babylonians did not use the hour, but did use a double-hour lasting 120 modern minutes, a time-degree lasting four modern minutes, and a barleycorn lasting 31⁄3 modern seconds (the helek of the modern Hebrew calendar),[10] but did not sexagesimally subdivide these smaller units of time. No sexagesimal unit of the day was ever used as an independent unit of time. In 1000, the Persian scholar al-Biruni gave the times of the new moons of specific weeks as a number of days, hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths after noon Sunday.[4] In 1267, the medieval scientist Roger Bacon stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (horae, minuta, secunda, tertia, and quarta) after noon on specified calendar dates.[11] Although a third for 1⁄60 of a second remains in some languages, for example Polish (tercja) and Turkish (salise), the modern second is subdivided decimally. -  URL_0 
Certain medals will let you receive benefits such as compensation, medical preference, educational (for yourself or family), and lower rates on things like license plates, free access to state parks. A lot of it varies by state, though. I wouldn't say "they mean squat" (especially coming from someone who didn't serve in the US military). [Purple Heart Benefits]( URL_0 ) [Medal of Honor Benefits]( URL_1 ) Edit: Just wanted to address some of the other comments: Yes, all service members get to use Tuition Assistance while in. Once you get out, you can use the GI Bill. You can transfer those benefits to a family member if you've been in at least 10 years. I know California and Indiana your child can attend a state school for a certain amount of credit hours (in Indiana where I live it's enough to get a Bachelors), but you often have to have a disability rating--not necessarily a Purple Heart of Medal of Honor. For example, in Indiana you only need a 10% rating. The medals OP asked about do have additional benefits. The stuff above is essentially a given, provided you meet the Time in Service requirements and the disability rating requirements. It does help with your medical preference so you have a somewhat easier time getting treated, as if you were given either of these, you'll probably need future treatment.

It's the leftover color when you're trying to balance a system that involves elemental types of damage. Red has a strong association with fire and heat, and likewise Blue has a strong association with cold, ice and water. Electricity tends to be another very common damage type and is generally tied to the color Yellow -- signs warning about electrical dangers even tend to be bright Yellow. If you're trying to deal with simple primary colors that leaves you with Green, and a common damage type that's left over once you've made your way through Fire, Ice and Electricity is either Poison or Acid, so those often get relegated to Green. In short, it's often Fire=Red, Water=Blue, Lightning/Air=Yellow, Poison/Acid/Radiation/Earth=Green. The concept of using sickly-green or greenish-yellow colors to represent acids and poisons goes back further than that, though. There's a TVTropes article about it:  URL_0

As others have said the Rosetta Stone was vital in beginning understanding. Beyond that we know because it keeps making sense. So as an example. Why did the ¥ cross the road? The ¥ we ate last night was good. We had fried ¥. The ¥s ran out of the coop. The ¥ feathers were beige. We can start narrowing in on what ¥ is because there are only certain things that can be filled in and make sense. In this case birds are really the only thing that work, in particular I started with chicken. Sometimes we don't have an absolute answer but a close enough answer that can be used. As we see the symbols more we have more knowledge about what the symbol means. It is actually the same way you learn new words, the context eventually reveals the information, and as you hear the word more often you can fix any mistakes you've made in the meaning.
First off, teachers don't work 9/12ths of the year. They don't just show up on the first day that students arrive and they don't leave when students do. They don't stop working at 3 when school ends for students, but keep going into the night and often weekends doing grading, prep, parent calls, conferences, meetings, etc. I'm not a teacher myself because I couldn't handle it. Honestly. I know way too many teachers and know that I couldn't handle the job they do. Second, many places require more than a Bachelor's degree. Where I live, a postgraduate degree is required. Teachers are also typically required to attend regular professional development courses throughout their careers. These are extra university courses that they have to pay for regularly. Third, it's not a lot in comparison to other jobs that have less responsibility and requirements. A median salary of $53k is in the same ballpark as restaurant managers ($53k), construction crane operators ($53k), postal carriers ($51k), bricklayers ($51k)... none of which require investing in education and none of which are responsible for our children's futures. **EDIT** So I don't have to repeat myself a million times in the comments: No, I'm *not* saying that people in blue collar jobs don't have skills or don't deserve to earn money. Don't put words in my mouth. I've worked blue collar jobs and fully appreciate how skilled tradesmen can be and how necessary those jobs are. I *am* saying that it costs more in time and money to get the degrees necessary to become a teacher while most trades are learned either through cheaper, shorter-term courses and/or on-the-job training. I'm sure you can point out trades that cost more to learn, but I'd also bet most of those pay more. If not, then they too are probably underpaid. **EDIT 2** [Source for the numbers was the Bureau of Labor Statistics.]( URL_0 )

Giving two weeks notice is a courtesy. You don't *have* to give a two weeks notice, you can text your boss "I quit" and never come in to work again. There are no repercussions, they still owe you whatever outstanding pay you have, etc. Just don't expect a good reference.
Besides everyone saying that either they don't, or that it's based just on voltage- modern devices use something called a Coulomb Counter which actually measures the quantity of charge leaving or entering the battery. Imagine you have a water tank. Every few seconds, you check a meter to see how fast water is coming out of the tap. Then you can add up these measurements to figure out pretty closely how much is left in the tank! Technically speaking, the device measures current consumption rapidly and performs integration to give a figure of amp-hours or watt-hours consumed.
Osmosis. During a deep periodontal cleaning, the water jet blasts lots of bacteria and other debris off your teeth and into your gums, creating lots of micro-abrasions in the process. Salt water creates negative osmotic pressure, which draws water from your blood and lymph fluids through those micro-abrasions and cleans all the junk out of them. Clean wounds heal faster.
The format (apart from the tool standard) follows function and/or aesthetics - conic flat heads for when they need to be flush with the surface for example. Now, for the tool standard, they differ due to cost, application, evolution, competing standards, etc. The old simple slotted head is cheap to make and good for hand turning, but when you use an electric tool, they make it dufficult to keep the driver centered, so you start needing something different. The phillips type was developed with this in mind; it's self-centering, but they are also more prone to get damaged if the tool slips or a lot of torque is needed. For this case, the allen is better (albeit not self centering, but good for automated robot assembly). But hey, with excess torque it's also possible to damage the screw head - specially with the wrong size due to the metric/imperial mess of allen tools. Let's come up with an evolution - torx. No slipping, single size standard, more self-centering than allen (IMO, the best, we should only have torx). But that's more expensive to make than the old single slot, I guess, and relatively "new". Then there are the ones specifically made to avoid tinkering (require special, not easily available tools), and the opposite: ones made so you can use either a phillips or a standard slot screwdriver (I suppose for stuff designed to be self assembled by the average consumer who doesn't have dozens of screwdrivers).
Infinite doesn't mean everything. It just means that counting it doesn't ever come to an end. I'll give you a simple example. You know that the integers are infinite. If you start counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...., you'll never come to an end. But it's also true that if you just count the evens 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...., you'll also never come to an end. So the evens are infinite too, even though it is missing ALL the odd numbers. So the first thing to erase in your head is that "infinite" means "everything".
You don't. You use a process called "tacking" which means you sail a zig zag pattern to get where you are going. Much like a switch back when climbing a steep hill. Putting the bow (front) of the boat straight into the wind puts you "in irons" (i.e. the sails are not catching the wind and you don't go anywhere). Edit: I've also heard the process called "beating."
If somebody could answer this question, they'd probably win a nobel prize. Seriously, there's a lot we don't know about sleep. The short answer is basically "genetics". But exactly how that works for some people is largely a mystery.
Your example is just a movie lot. With fancy editing, a very enclosed space can seem much more expansive. The same can be done when shooting on location: close off half a block of city street and shoot it from three different angles, you can make it seem like you're shooting across half a mile of city. But CGI is used a LOT more than you might think to replace backgrounds and add detail. Check out [this video.] ( URL_0 ) I'm willing to bet you never would have guessed that most or even all of those were entirely faked.

Because Germany wasn't really itself again until 1992. After WWII the main other competitors in the world war basically called dibs on a quarter of Berlin each, then there was the Cold War and while that was going on Germany started growing again, eventually ripping down that irritating wall and becoming united again. That union is what made it considered truly Germany again, but prior to that the country was still rebuilding and being productive. Resulting in it being seen as a quick recovery, but I'm not sure it really was quick so much as distracted from.
When you drink lots of cranberry juice... Actual juice, not the concentrate(and by this I meant to say the mixtures that are mostly water... So cran-apple juice), it doesn't allow bacteria to stick to your pee hole. This lowers risk of getting infection. It isn't exactly good for your kidneys, just to decrease risk of urinary tract infection. Source... Pharmacist and I tried to explain like you were 5. Edit: forgot to mention it does not cure a UTI.
Sugar is poured into the center of a spinning drum and is heated to melting point. Once the sugar melts the spinning of the drum forces the liquid sugar through small holes outward towards the sides of the drum in small strings (imagine spider webs). These small strings of liquid cool and become non liquid sugar and then are wrapped around sticks as fluffy candy.
It's a complicated answer with a few causes so I will try to go over a few. Insurance premiums are high because costs to insurance companies are high. These costs come from a few sources. Hospitals do not refuse ER treatment to the uninsured and when those people default on the HUGE bills, the hospital must just deal with that. Because of this, people who CAN pay (insurance companies), must pay extra for the hospital to break even/ make a profit. This is only a small part of the story, though. Costs are high because doctors get paid a lot. Not that they do not deserve a high salary, but the cost of *becoming* a doctor is incredible. Due to this, a high salary is required to pay off the mountains of debt each doctor is likely in from getting an education. Costs are high because of pharmaceutical companies charging thousands of dollars per dose of lifesaving medication. Insurance companies try to encourage people towards generics because it costs much, much less to them. Let's say you need Pill A to live. Pill A is a name brand which costs $1,00 per dose. There is a generic version of Pill A available at only $200 per dose and it works just as well. Your doctor may not know what the actual cost of Pill A is, and he prescribes it to you. You have an option to go with a generic but many people prefer a name brand. Co-Pays exist to encourage you to choose alternatives like generics. Let's say you have a $100 co-pay on Pill A, but only a $5 co-pay on the generic. This is your insurance company's way of encouraging you to the cheaper option. If you choose the generic, your insurance company has to pay the other $195 that is left after your co-pay. That sounds like a lot still, but it's still better for them than having to pay the other $900 left for the name brand Pill A. Costs are high because of malpractice insurance. Suing for medical malpractice is surprisingly easy, and because of this, doctors have to pay for insurance in case it happens to them. Whether it is a good or a bad thing is irrelevant: these costs are passed on to the consumer. Costs are high because of how insurance works on a fundamental basis. Young, healthy people are MUCH less likely to actually make claims on their insurance. Old/sick people are MUCH more likely to go to the hospital and therefore they make more claims to the insurance company. The insurance company needs to have a LOT of young, healthy people paying every month to have enough money to pay for sick people as well as make a profit. This is called the insurance 'pool'. The larger the pool is, the lower the costs can be for each person in the pool. A big insurance company has more healthy people paying in, which mitigates the costs of the fewer number of sick people. There are other reasons at all, but it's impressive that a 5 year old is in a micro econ class.
So the basic theory is that you damage a muscle just enough, it repairs itself and adapts to the stress that caused the damage. Very very roughly: a nearby ~~blastocyte~~ **myosatellite cell** is primed (including with the type of adaptation needed) by chemical signals the cell releases during damage, and after a threshold is passed, it grows in size and then fuses to the original, damaged cell. Pushing the absolute limits of your muscles' basic work capacity (low reps, high weight), means that after refusion the muscle cell will have more myofibrils, the basic element of a muscle cell that causes contraction. The thing is, myofibrils aren't really big, and your muscle can increase their concentration without changing in size much. Testing muscular endurance, draining the reserves of the muscle cell itself (high reps low weight, high time under tension), means the new cell with have additional sarcoplasm (sarco = muscle; plasm = goo; cytoplasm is the generic name for cell goo). Sarcoplasm is filled with stuff that exists to maintain the cell and keep the myofibrils supplied and repaired. But it's mostly water, so double the sarcoplasm means double the muscle fiber size. Note that if you go another step out—conditioning, stamina/endurance training, cardio, whatever you wanna call it—the muscular endurance itself is no longer being tested, but only the rate that the body can resupply the muscle, so you get better heart and lung health, and denser capillary beds in the muscle itself. Power training is a mild outlier, though only compared to people that don't generally do strength training anyways. There's a certain minimum amount of sarcoplasm your body needs to do the extremely high energy rate required of stuff like Olympic lifting. edit: Oh, I almost forgot my final note, which is that while this has been generally accepted fact for quite some time, and reinforced by various studies, there's been a recent meta-study that found other studies that showed "high reps low weight" did not produce significantly more muscle mass increase than "low reps high weight". I wouldn't completely accept its conclusion yet, but it's easy to understand how confusion could persist in the sports science and physique competition community (in either direction). There are many confusing factors. Individual differences (some people just are genetic miracles); different methods and goals between the body building, power lifting, olympic lifting, and other sport training communities; the *incredible* proliferation of nonsense from laypeople and pretend-expert magazine writers; the beginner effect (almost literally anything with weights, the dumbest shit imaginable, will work beautifully for anybody... for about six to twelve months); performance enhancing drugs, pressures to lie about them... the list goes on. edit2: Another point of confusion is that there's no such thing as pure strength lifting or pure hypertrophy lifting. If you're lifting to the point where repair (and thus adaptation) is required, both will be improved, just one more than the other based on the type. edit3: /u/arcflash90 pointed out it's not blastocyte (which is a word I guess I made up). It's a kind of muscle stem cell called a myosatellite cell. edit4: I'm getting a lot of complaints like /u/Evil-Imp's "I just read this to my 5 year old, and now he's crying." Sorry it's a bad habit of mine. In the engineering spirit of not reduplicating work, I'm going to steal /u/Almae's [great breakdown]( URL_0 ) (please upvote them if you like it):  > Training for power repairs muscles similar to adding more cylinders to the engine block of your car. Training for muscular endurance is akin to making your gas tank bigger Training for stamina is akin to building more gas stations along your route. I guess it maybe needs something like... muscle engine cylinders are small so you can pack them in tightly, which means muscle don't grow? edit5: [an even better metaphor]( URL_1 ) (with midgets!) by /u/ElbowStrike edit7 ^(had a few people ask so) **TL;DR**: few reps per set (1–7ish) = stronger muscles lots of reps per set (like 8–20) = bigger muscles *You always lift as much weight as you can handle for that number of reps!* High reps just means the weight has to be lower, high reps low weight isn't the same as actually going *light*. More than 20 reps affects muscles relatively little (some, but not much); it's primarily a cardio work out at that point. Your muscles might get sore from lactic acid, but it's not really the muscle itself that's being taxed, so they won't grow (at least not much). A lot of exercise programming confusion is because weight training for intermediate lifters is totally different than it is for beginners; which is why advice aimed at people lifting for years is confusing for a beginner. And one of the most common reasons for a beginners muscles to stop growing is because they need to eat more.
Edit: Thanks for the gold! Early morning surgery is mostly about a condition called ileus. Other commenters have pointed out that fasting compliance is greater before breakfast. While having an empty stomach for anesthesia induction is important (mostly to prevent stomach contents from going places they shouldn't -- like the lung) and likewise not having a lot of blood flow to the gut while maneuvering there is also good those are generally minor considerations (you can drain stomach contents fairly easily if required). One of the more serious potential side effects of surgery and anesthesia is this condition called ileus, it is essentially when your intestines stop working because of surgery. This disease is caused by surgery and can be diagnosed as soon as the anesthesia wears off. While many cases resolve on their own (watch and wait), cases that don't have potential to cause serious harm to the patient. And because of how the gut works and the post-surgical medicines, by the time a patient complains of their symptoms, serious harm may be done. But what does that have to do with morning surgery? Essentially, after you have completed surgery and recovery (which takes some time), your surgeon can then start to examine you for ileus (using a stethoscope to listen for activity, observing passing gas or a bowel movement). With early morning surgery, patients start recovering between lunch and dinner when their gut is primed for activity which when combined with the water (which can trick the body into starting the digestive process) makes the condition much easier to detect. Having the patient recovered from anesthesia also gives some 'lead time' to allow the disease to resolve itself (many cases of ileus resolve themselves within ~4 hours) before making decisions about whether to keep the person overnight. If you are doing a surgery starting at 2pm, by the time the person is out of recovery, they are already shutting down for the night, harder to hear whether ileus is present. (Another consideration for early morning surgery, is to avoid unnecessary drowsiness when out of anesthesia) So with early morning surgery, you make the disease easier to find and prevent (at least some) people from staying overnight if they don't have to. There's lots of other more minor considerations and factors that make life easier, but the ileus is the big factor and why surgeons almost universally start surgery early. Tl;dr: After recovery, fart for your surgeon, it will be music to their ears.
 URL_0   URL_1  Game of Thrones began development in January 2007 (pitches to HBO and Martin happened in 2006). The first episode was filmed in 2009. The first episode aired in April 2011, over 4 years after development began and two years after it was filmed. In other words, OP, your question is faulty. With the casting, development, location scouting, contracts, etc... done, they can produce season 2 in a year subsequent to season 1, sure. But season 1, and specifically the building of that infrastructure, took years. Movies operate the same way. Especially in circumstances where you know, when casting the movie, drafting the contracts, and working out schedules etc, that should the movie succeed you will want to release a sequel quickly thereafter. Doubly so when you are adapting from already published source material.
"Islamic State", or other terms including that, is what they want to be called. It implies they are both Islamic and a state. The UK government does not acknowledge them as a state. And they also want to push the idea that they are not really Islamic, to stop people jumping to the conclusion that all Muslims are like them. Daesh was created as a derogatory term for them which doesn't acknowledge them as a state or Islamic (at least not in English).
Ever notice that the line on the side of the road is white while it is yellow down the middle? That is because in fog it is vital to see the edge of the road. White shows up better in fog. White boats don't hit each other as much in fog, then.
Oceans are saltwater, which land based plant life can't grow in. Also, the sand of a desert doesn't hold the moisture and nutrients necessary for plants to grow. Some deserts are growing because the soil near it is losing water and nutrients, so the plants are dying, and can no longer hold the soil, so desert takes over. This can extend all the way to an ocean.
There's a phrase my school teacher used to say, "Water tends to find it's own level." I think porn sites actually is a great example of that. If you go to any random porn site, and then they have a lot of, say, pregnant porn uploaded by the users, people who do not like pregnant porn might stay away from it. The more people that stray because of the prevalence of pregnant porn, the more concentrated the pregnant porn has become on that site, until that site has a reputation for being the site for pregnant porn. Tumblr's vocal social justice commentators have likewise turned people who aren't into that away from the site, leaving it more concentrated, so if you *are* into that you're more likely to post there.
Imagine if a plane with hundreds of people, 50 of them Americans and 150 Canadian, disappeared between Chicago and Montreal. Now imagine if we stopped looking after a couple weeks. That's why everyone is still looking.
Mao was not merely trying to improve literacy, he was attempting to scour Chinese culture for all references to the past and systematically destroy them in order to create an idealized New China. Simple Chinese is one of many cultural weapons Mao and the Chinese authority used to homogenize Chinese culture and strip elements like regionalism, Confucism, and liberalism from the language. The Japanese certainly had a similar bout of authoritarianism but Facism generally looks to honor the past while Communism as we saw in China was about destroying the past. That's one of the key differences between Communism and Facism as opposites on the far left and far right side of the political spectrum.
The digestive system is a long tube that starts at your mouth and ends at... the end. The muscles in the intestines contract and push the food downward. This also helps turn the food, liquid and whatever else into a gooey mix. This is what results in a growling stomach. Two hours after your stomach empties itself, the nerves send a message to the brain, which sends a message to your digestive system to restart the contractions. This gets any remaining food that is sitting there from the last time. These vibrations will make you hungry. They'll come and go every hour and last about 10 to 20 minutes until you eat something. To avoid this happening in a quiet setting, eat many small meals a day instead of 2-3 large ones so your stomach doesn't have time to restart the process.
Trash is just a folder where files go when you delete them so that you have an option to restore them if you deleted accidentally, they work just as any other folder. When you empty the bin, the file is really deleted from the file system perspective. Typically the data that were stored in the file is not erased, only the reference to it (so called inode if you want to google) is deleted and the space the file occupied is marked "empty" so the next time a file is created, or an existing file gets larger, the data of the original file will be overwritten. It is done so because it's a fast way of deleting files, it takes practically the same time to delete a 100 GB file as it takes to delete 1 KB file and since many programs use files to communicate with each other, this prevents writing big amounts of data when deleting temporary files. If the data haven't been overwritten yet, i.e. shortly after deleting the file, it can usually be restored using some tools. There are even techniques to (at least partly) restore data that have been overwritten. There are programs that try to delete the files in a way that is really permanent, i.e. they rewrite the data several times to ensure the data can't be restored. This is handy when you want to get rid of some sensitive data.
Most of them aren't very sophisticated - definitely not what most people think of by "artificial intelligence". They generally just pursue short term goals  &  follow a set of premade strategies. Most game AIs are made stronger by giving them advantages over human players (ie - 'cheating' rather than being smarter)
He's not *really* giving out health advice. Instead, he protects himself by merely reporting what others say. He'll never say "/u/DanaNotDonna's itchy feet will be cured by eating dryer lint." Instead, he'll quote a study like this: "According to a recent study by the Home Appliance Institute, 57% of people who eat dryer lint say their feet do not itch." So it's the authors of the study making the claim, except not really. The study authors are going to say something non-committal like "Although a positive correlation was found between dryer lint consumption and non-itchy feet, more study is needed and it will be several years before the production of dryer-lint based medicines." Dr. Oz can also shield himself by interviewing a guest about the problem instead of making any statement himself. "What options are there for people with itchy feet?" "Well, a recent study . . ." So, you'll have to go through 3 or more layers of people to finally find someone who didn't really say your itchy feet would be helped by the dryer lint anyway.
You don't get energy from sleeping. Your body gets energy from food. What sleep does is repair damage to your body and allow your brain to rest. When your brain doesn't have enough rest, it stops working as efficiently. But without food, your body won't have enough energy to do anything. Think of food as the gas you put into your car, and sleep as the occasional oil change you need to keep your car working properly.
It is important for public health purposes to notice if a large number of people are dying from a particular cause. Epidemics used to be much more common than they are now.
Hmm, tougher than it seems... Oh, I know a way, but you really have to think like a five-year-old. Suppose I told you, "take two steps *forward* three times". You are now six steps away from the starting position, in the "forward" direction. This is 2x3=6. Now imagine you're at the starting point again, and I'm telling you, "take two steps *back* three times". You are now six steps away from start in the "back" direction. This is -2x3=-6. Now you're at the starting point again and I'm telling you, "*turn around* and make two steps *forward* three times". You are now facing the opposite way, so you end up the same six steps away in the "back" direction. This is 2x(-3)=-6. Finally, you're at the starting point and I'm telling you: "*turn around* and make two steps *back* three times." See? You're moving "backwards" *while* facing "backwards", so you end up six steps away in the *forward* direction. And this is -2x(-3)=6. The nice thing about this explanation is that you can actually try it out. *EDIT: fixed missing minus sign in third example, thanks for noticing*
the non-active proteins trigger an immune system response which can involve some inflammatory system responses. once the immune system is activated for that infection your body will react more readily if the actual infection gets into you.
This doesn't actually happen - it's an outdated scientific theory and a very common [urban myth]( URL_0 ). Basically, most women will bleed one out of every four weeks. If you have a bunch of women living together, there will naturally be overlaps between their individual cycles, and some people have misread this as "synching". But the theory is largely discredited by now.
You power up your CV by doing volunteer work and. I know this sounds super shitty and exploitative, but unpaid or minimum wage work experience.
Thankyou for posting this. **One question!** - how do the mods address posts where the answers are in no way written to be elementary friendly? As you mentioned, this isn't /r/answers but the amount of overly descriptive responses that wouldn't be understood by anyone in elementary school is rapidly ruining my enjoyment of this sub-reddit :( [Example]( URL_0 ) - Sure it's a good read and and a great explanation but in no way would this be understood by a child.
It has to do with the way that the electrons are arranged. Electrons can also absorb photons to jump up energy levels - but only if there's the right amount of energy in the photon to do a complete jump. Electrons won't jump up anything but whole energy levels. This means that there has to be the right amount of energy in the light in order for it to be absorbed. With light, energy is proportional to the frequency, which is inversely proportional to the wavelength. This means there's a direct relationship between wavelength and energy. This is why glass, for example, is transparent. The amount of energy necessary to excite electrons in glass doesn't match the amount of energy that photons have when they're in the visible part of the spectrum, so the photons go whizzing on through without being absorbed.
Because websites and programmes can be used everywhere in the world, where local laws may or may not be the same as those applicable to the location of the programmer / issuing company. You know where a restaurant is located, and it follows local laws and regulations (or should, anyway), and its customers are also supposed to adhere to those laws.

I work in food regulatory. There are many ways possible. The most common, and likely way, is that individual parts of the flavor are made by different people who don't have access to the complete flavor. For example, in a butter flavor which I have been a part of, the primary butter is melted and added to oil and esters, then it sits until afternoon shift and some other ingredients added. Then the next day it might get spray drier into a carrier. If you wanted to make it secret, simply only give each shift what they need to know. And it can be spread over multiple facilities , even. And that is for a very simple flavor. For complex ones, it is so easy. Just have a bunch of intermediates, and combine. Each group only knows A portion of the whole thing. I also have heard that coke obfuscated ingredients by purposely buying useless ingredients, so that no one would know for sure which ingredients are actually used. This is how they are kosher, each ingredient, the real and false are certified, and coke can use any subset thereof, and it will remain kosher.
Firstly, materials. They don't have that kind of munition stockpiles. Secondly, retaliation. Congrats, you're shelling a FOB 24-7. You've now pissed off the entire military force behind it even more royally than before. Air support is a given. Possibly artillery. You getting flanked is also likely. They will light up your world like the motherfucking sun if you shell an FOB. You're stationary when you're attacking, so you're a sitting duck, and you're in the crosshairs of a real military power, not other guys with AKs. Missiles, gun runs, artillery, surprise attacks, all likely to happen to you. When you're stationary in an attack, you can be traced. It can be calculated where that mortar is being launched from. It can be found where that gunfire is coming from. And then you're at the wrong end of a Hellfire Missile. Have fun with that.
I've heard about this from somewhere, not sure where now, and it went like this: It's a silent signal that we are in pain and need help, so when the... flock? tribe?... see this they can help you. If we instead only shouted we would also attract predators who seek easy targets, so we were more likely to die. Then I would guess it evolved so that it just got triggered by strong feelings. No idea if this is true though, but it seems believable ^^ EDIT: I read this in [this humor article]( URL_1 ) at the end, but the link to one of their sources is dead, [the other one]( URL_0 ) says that crying strengthens relationships.
Edited to include source at the end. [edited again because I Elendil-ed when I should have Earendil-ed] Yes. At the end of the Silmarillion Morgoth (the scariest dude ever and Sauron's boss) is trapped in a void where he's guarded by Earendil (a guy who took one of the Silmarils and pilots his ship around in space). At some point in the future Morgoth will escape the void and bring about the end of the world. It is very much like Ragnarok, with the free peoples (elves, good men, dwarves etc.) on one side and the forces of darkness on the other. This war would destroy Middle-earth, bringing about a new world that incorporates some of the better features of the Middle-earth while staying true to Eru Illuvatar's (that's the person who created Middle-earth) ideal vision for it. For example, snow was never part of Illuvatar's vision, it was created accidentally when Morgoth created cold. Something like that would stay, while orcs would not. Hope that helped!

first of all, they do. Ducks try a lot. There are species of flowers that release pheromones of female wasps/bees to attract males and trick the males into pollinating. Dolphins do all kinds of things. Secondly, most animals have behaviors specific to their species, mating behaviors, chemical scents, physical signals, etc specifically so the animals avoid such confusions because wasted mating is wasted food/energy/risk
Because lead-acid batteries have horrible energy densities. Nickel Cadmium too, anyone who has used RC planes before Lipos knows how blessed we are today. Li-ion only commercialized in the 90s and even now li-ion has a rather low energy density compared to fuel. Batteries (and supercapacitors) are very tricky, a lot that works in the lab doesn't work outside. It also took us a very long time before we knew what to do with semi-conductors, sometimes it takes just takes a long time to improve something enough to make it viable. People are too quick to blame it all on "corporate greed". Edit: There's also the problem that batteries lose capacity from discharging, which has improved a lot over 100 years.(cycle durability has increased) Charge/discharge efficiency has also improved a lot over the last 100 years.
You just graduated high school? There's a job at the auto plant, or the mill, or the shipyard for you. In a few years you can buy a car, a house. You can start a family in your house with your stable job with good benefits and a guaranteed retirement fund in your mid 20s, heck, maybe even by 21. Your union is powerful. Your union gives you the kind of leverage to make sure you don't get screwed over the way CEOs have leverage to get golden parachutes. This is before there starts being backlash not against the exorbitant golden parachutes for the insulated, coddled executives, but against the leeches trying to put food on their tables asking for a raise to compensate for inflation and asking that their pensions not be ransacked or taken away. People with high school or bachelor degrees easily rise up through the ranks. If they need extra training the company provides that training for them.
The impact of the temperature rising by a few degrees F isn't that it feels hotter when you go outside on Saturday afternoon, that it's now 93F instead of 90F. That's not it. It's that a bunch of the earth's cycles now operate significantly differently. This leads to dramatically different weather patterns and sea levels, which pose risks for civilization. It's not inherently *bad*, it's just risky for humans and what we have built. If you need an analogy to reason through this, think of human body temperature. It's normally around 98.6F. Crank it up to 102F, and you're very sick. Keep it at 102F for an extended period, and you are suffering, sick, and probably(?) eventually die. And if your body temperature stays at 95F for an extended period of time, you suffer and probably(?) die. That's an example of a system that runs into serious problems if its temperature changes by a few degrees. As for filtering carbon out of the air, there are three main problems. The first is that this process would require tons of energy. The second is that it would have to be deployed at a positively ENORMOUS scale. We emit 36 billion *tons* of carbon per year. The third problem is what to do with all of that carbon, do we turn it back into oil and bury it, or what? And the last problem is, of course, the astronomical cost. Science can make carbon filtration systems, they already operate on some power plants. It is possible. But to deploy them at large scale is not feasible.
Good: A company is for sale for $100. I decide to buy it. I'll put up $10 of my own money and borrow $90 at 10 & #37; interest. I sell it 1 year later for 20 & #37; more, or $120. I pay off the $90 loan and $9 of interest and keep $21. On my $10 investment, I made $11. That's a big return. Bad: A company is for sale for $100. I decide to buy it. I'll put up $10 of my own money and borrow $90 at 10 & #37; interest. The company starts tanking and I can only sell it for $80. I can't pay off the loan and interest. I lose all my money and company declares bankruptcy.
As others have posted here, not just humans but many animals tend to birth one offspring, while many others have lots of babies at one time. As a species you can adopt one of two strategies: you can have lots of babies so that even if some die, others will hopefully survive to the age where they can reproduce. The disadvantage of this is that you have to spread your love around - you can't spend as much time and attention on each one as you could if you had fewer kids. The other strategy is to have few babies, and pour as much time, love and attention to them as possible to ensure they will survive. These two strategies are known as [r/K selection theory]( URL_0 ). Species like fruit-flies that have tons of kids are r-selected. This is generally a better strategy in an unstable environment. Humans, cows and others that normally have one kid at a time are K-selected. This strategy is better in a more stable environment, where you can expect to live long enough to reproduce again later in life.
Depends on what you define as lately. There haven't been many plane crashes with high fatalities the last couple of years so compared with 2013 and 2012, 2014 is looking to be a bad year. The number of plane crashes isn't higher than 2013, 2012 though, it is just that there have been a few crashes with a lot of fatalities. If you go back to 2000 or earlier there were a lot more plane crashes and a lot more fatalities. Statistically speaking the risk of a plane crash have only gone down in recent years.  URL_0 
Why do you think there ought to be legal issues? Anyone can use any other brand in their commercial so long as they don't construe that brand as endorsing your own (without their permission) or say anything untrue about it. You usually won't see a company show a competitor's brand in their commercial because they don't want to increase their competitor's brand recognition. Since it's impossible to increase Coke's brand recogition (it is the most recognized brand in the world), there's no incentive for Pepsi to avoid using them on this count.
Because video games are being rendered on your local machine. The World of Warcraft servers aren't sending frames to your computer, they're sending "player "loldude" x=2563 y=4403 NPC "person mcPersonson" x=2582 y=4430 ...", and your computer uses that information to inform how it builds the screen that gets shown to you. When you're streaming, then you are actually sending frames over the internet. You need to send the color data for every single pixel on the screen, as well as the audio that goes with it.
It's a series of numbers. And you can copy it, but you can still only spend it once because the transaction ledger- the list of which wallets sent which bitcoins to which other wallets- is public. It's not like spending a Bitcoin physically removes the data from your computer and sends it in a tube to the other computer. It's just that you need the other machines mining bitcoins to verify your transaction and they won't verify it if you try to spend it twice.
I think the significance is a subjective thing - to me, it is the fact that at one time Mars behaved a lot like Earth did - it had an active core, and an atmosphere that was capable of generating and maintaining a water supply. This in turn supports the possibility that at one time there may have been life on Mars (or at the very least that life could theoretically have been supported at one time). This means that, even though many of the planets we've discovered are dead like Mars currently, they may not have been at one time. That in turn means that, given trillions of planets, there are very likely to be some that are CURRENTLY not dead, and therefore could currently be supporting life. Source: NOT a scientist or someone educated on this matter in any way - this is purely my initial reaction to the announcement.
You have arteries which supply the blood and veins which take it away, but in between those two is a massive spiderweb of smaller capillaries which get that good blood to every cell in the body then take it away once the cells get what they need. So even though you have had an amputation, there are still thousands of connections between your arteries and veins in what remains of that amputated limb.  URL_0   URL_1 
If you have a large venue, just one audio source (amp) isn't going to fill up the whole room, but you'll also probably have a large speaker system that's built specifically for filling the room with sound. So you mic the amp and send the sound out through those speakers. The reason you mic it instead of going direct out is because using the mic will give the the natural tone of the amp which will generally sound better than the raw audio signal. Also it allows a sound tech to mix levels on his own without having to constantly tell you in your monitors to turn up or turn down slightly
It's called kwashiorkor, and it's a sign of serious protein deficiency. The stomach gets bloated because of fluid retention and because the liver expands with fat deposits. Interestingly enough, kwashiorkor gets its name from what an African tribe called it. Translated, it means "disease of the deposed child". What would happen is that when a 2nd child was born, the first child would be abruptly cut off breast milk and put onto a more adult diet high in carbs and low in protein. This resulted in protein deficiency.
Rain in the tropics is normally air mass thunderstorms and other downpours from vertical convection (heating at the surface causing air to rise). I think you're imagining Western Europe. In Western Europe the Atlantic is so warm it provides warmth to the land in Fall, Spring, and Winter--the tradeoff of supplying that warmth is steady, misty moisture as the warm moist air condenses on the cooler land.
Why does adding one oxygen to water change it from being refreshing to a corrosive nightmare? Even seemingly minor alterations to a chemical structure can radically alter the way it interacts with itself and other molecules. In this particular case, the methyl group in *meth*amphetamine is altering the electron structure around the adjacent nitrogen center, which significantly accelerates its reactivity.
It's actually pretty simple. The term for a check to see if you are awake or asleep is a Reality Check. Think of the spinning thing in inception, even though its much more complicated than it has to be, it's a reality check. My favorite check is to pinch your nose and attempt to breathe through your nostrils. If your dreaming you're not really pinching your nose and you will feel the air flow very distinctly, if not you won't be able to breathe. Don't suffocate.
Well, we are pretty geographically isolated - we only share a border with 2 countries. Since most other nation states would have to cross an ocean to get to us, it makes invasions hard. As for what would happen, we would win. We have, by far [the most powerful military in the world]( URL_0 ). No other country even comes close.
Don't change a site's password until they post that they've implemented the fix, or you might need to do it again.
If you tried to wash your hair with water, not all of the oil would leave. This is because oil and water do not mix together. When you add special chemicals called detergents, the chemicals that clean things, they can fix the problem. This is because a detergent has two ends. One end likes water and one end likes oil. So, all of the ends that like oil gather around the oil. The ends that like water stick out of the outside of the ball, and water can wash them away. Also, did you ever notice how water stays in a pile when you spill it on a table? Water is attracted to itself. Chemicals called 'surfacants' help the water get through your hair more easily because they make the water like other things more than itself. There are also chemicals added to keep the mixture together called emulsifiers. Shampoo also has a lot of stuff in it that makes it pretty and fun to use. Some shampoos are shiny and you can't see through them. There are chemicals that do that too. Titanium dioxide is used to make it harder to see through things. It is even used in sunscreens because the sun can't get through to hurt your skin. But sometimes,when you clean your hair with detergent, you get rid of the good oils as well as the bad oils. This makes the hair brittle and makes the hair want to stick together. Chemicals like silicone in conditioner cover hair. Two strands of hair would stick to each other, but two hairs covered in silicone are slippery to each other. Other chemicals can make a protein called keratin stronger in your hair. Like covering a broken brick wall in glue. There are also chemicals that add missing keratin to your hair like hydrolyzed proteins. It's like going over to a broken brick wall and putting bricks where there are bricks missing. Different shampoos use different chemicals to do different things. So the best shampoo for you may not be the best shampoo for other people. Marketing doesn't always tell the truth in a clear way. Like, if you broke a lamp and said 'it fell off of the shelf.' Technically, it did. But you bumped it causing it to fall. Marketing companies could say shampoo A cleans with chemical B. People think that means that chemical B cleans really well. But really, legally, it means that shampoo A cleans and shampoo A has chemical B. Sometimes, words are used to trick people on purpose. So, some are better than others, but it sort of depends on what you like and what you need for your hair. A girl with lots of curly hair would use different shampoo and conditioner than a guy with short straight hair. The guy would have a lot of oil coming off of his scalp onto not a lot of hair so he could need more detergent. The girl with curly hair would be worried about her hair getting frizzy because of how curly it is, so she would want better conditioners that make her curls better. But that kind of conditioner would be a wasteful thing for the guy to buy.
Gasoline has an additive called benzene to help boosts its octane rating. Benzene is a chemical that has been known to have a sweet smell and can cause 'euphoria' if too much is inhaled.
Imagine you had a ping pong ball, and you filled it with cool whip. Now shrink that whole thing down to the size of a fly. Now imagine you threw that tiny little shell full of goop at the wall. Even if you threw it as hard as you could, it's still soooo tiny and soooo tough and bouncy on the outside that it'll just bounce off. Flies are super tiny, and have a shell just like that ping pong ball, but with little flexible, foldable wings. And just like a fly, if you use a slingshot instead of your hand (a moving car instead of a window) you might just get it to pop. **Edit for a bit more actual explanation:** Flies have an exoskeleton that's incredibly tough and hard in some spots, and just flexible enough to be springy and bouncy in others. Just like that ping pong ball, they've got a shell that's good at taking a bit of a hit and bouncing off instead of just squishing like a worm (which doesn't have that tough shell). The fact that they're so small helps in a couple different ways as well. For one, we *think* they're flying super fast, but it's really just because they're tiny. If you look at a massive airplane, it might be moving at 500 miles per hour but still looks like it's just crawling along across the sky. Houseflies look fast, but [I asked Google]( URL_0 ) and they only go about 5 miles per hour. That means a baseball pitcher can throw a fastball **20 times as fast as a housefly flies**. Not only are they actually super slow (if you don't let the size trick you), they also weigh almost nothing. Like, it would take about 200 flies to add up to the weight of a single ping pong ball, according to some quick Googling/converting. So your ping pong ball full of cool whip is actually super tough, reaaally slow, and unbelievably lightweight, meaning that dumb little fly was *designed* to fly into the window several thousand times before it finds the opening. Evolution at work.
there are still successes to be had, even when it's clear that you won't be the nominee. For example, your polling this cycle can be shown as a success story to potential campaign contributors next cycle ("Look, this poll shows I had 15% of registered party member's votes, with your help, I know we can push this up and succeed this year!). Also just because you aren't the lead candidate doesn't mean that you don't have a few good ideas that gain popularity...you are doing a service to the political party you represent, and the country as a whole by bringing light to these ideas/issues as often the main stream candidates will pick up on them. Finally, as unlikely as it might be, politics is a fickle bitch. A controversy with the current leader in the polls could suddenly change the game in your favor.
[I know this one!]( URL_0 ) In the beginning, there was USB. USB had two very precise physical characteristics: it was made so plugging the cable the wrong way and in the wrong orientation would be impossible. *This is why it has two differently-shaped ends*: so you don't plug it ass-backwards. So. The original USB cable had the rectangular plug we all know, meant to be plugged into your computer or whatever else was supposed to power the USB device (if any). At the time, there was just one sort of plug on the other side: the square plug. Also known as the Standard-B plug. The big-ass plug. But be warned: not a big ass-plug, unless you're a midget. Anyway, you still see those on printers commonly, and other large non-portable devices of the sort. We could say the Standard-B plug is the four-door sedan of USB plugs. Takes you where you need to go, solid and dependable. A tried and true design. Unfortunately, that plug was far too big for pocket devices, such as phones and cameras. So, there came the Mini-B plug. Same purpose, but tinier, and as you've assuredly noticed, a bit more fragile. You see that one notably on your Playstation 3 Controller. Somewhere around 2007 came Micro-B. Even smaller than Mini-B, fits in even tinier devices! It came to replace its predecessor, and now Mini-B is largely seen as deprecated: no new/current devices use Mini-B now, they'll all use Micro-B. Chances are your smartphone uses a Micro-B plug as a way to recharge itself. And now that USB 3.0 is out, prepare to see a new and improved Micro-B! That variant consists of a plug with a notch in the middle, and it's designed so its corresponding jack can still connect with Micro-B devices made prior to the introduction of USB 3.0. You'll see that one half of that notched plug looks exactly like the original Micro-B plug you've come to know. **Shuri, you wrote a fucking novel again. Help!** Basically, there are lots of different plugs because we ran out of space on the things we plug 'em on, *and* we improved on the original design.
In a non-rhotic accent like most British accents, an "r" is generally spoken between words if the first word ends in a vowel sound and the next word begins with one. So, you will hear "I have an idear about the car" but "I have an idea that you will like".
The United States has, since it's founding, taught it's schoolchildren the nation's history as a series of *narrative stories*. Discussions about the American revolution don't discuss the implications of post-war reconstruction on regional stability until the college level. As children, they learn about the Ride of Paul Revere and narratives about oppressed people being free. In those stories, the US founding fathers take on the role of the Knights of the Round Table, acting as perfectly just rulers who advocate equality, bravery, and good government. It's designed both to inspire patriotism and to help kids to remember some of those early laws and ideas by presenting a simple narrative of Good and Evil as a mnemonic to remember them by. As people grow up, the heroic tales of the Founding Fathers remain a part of their patriotism, and they feel a great attachment to the principles that those men said were sacred. The US constitution nevertheless changes frequently, with the latest change in 1992. Most of the changes to the document don't involve the 'core principles' of Right and Wrong that American schoolchildren are taught to remember though. Generally, when people say 'the constitution is a sacred document' they mean things like Freedom of Expression and the Right to Bear Arms rather than how the US constitution handles a sudden vacancy in the vice presidency. In other words, the Founding Fathers are a channel for people's political opinions surrounding right and wrong. When they are morally outraged by a law, they argue that the Founders would be. When they are okay with a change, generally they figure the Founders would, with today's evidence and information, be okay with a change too. Their actual opinions have very little bearing unless people still agree with them. For example, many of the Founding Fathers supported slavery, which we don't really talk about anymore. But when a quote can be found that matches a Founding Father with your opinion, it makes you feel really patriotic, so people quote them all the time. Plus they were some quotable gentlemen. Very literary, good command of language.
Wikipedia is not a source, just like how you aren't suppose to quote an encyclopedia. A very easy workaround is to use the sources that the Wikipedia article uses. If I was doing an article on Reddit, I wouldn't say "The name Reddit is a play on words "I read it on Reddit."" and quote the Wiki article on Reddit, I would use the source they used, which is Reddit's FAQ page,  URL_0 .
El Chapo's people reached out to him. All penn had to do follow chapos security and sit in the back of a truck for a couple hours
The cool thing about the experiment is that it's really quite simple, so I'd explain it to a 5 year old the same way I would to an adult. There's a box with a cat in it. Also in the box is a bottle of poison. If the cat inhales the potion, it will instantly die. Now let's say that the bottle has a 50/50 chance of already haven broken. Because it's in a box, there's no way for us to be sure what has happened, and no way for the outcome to effect us. It's not until we open the box that we can see if it's dead or alive. Schrödinger's point was that if we can not see the outcome of a random thing like this, for all intents and purposes the cat is simultaneously dead and alive, and stays like that until you observe otherwise. It's a pretty cool thought experiment, but it doesn't mean to much in our everyday lives.
My neighbour can be a real asshole, so I sometimes buy the local neighbourhood kids footballs which sometimes get kicked at his windows. But you can't prove I did it, and neither can he. And then you've got the whole "One mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter". Europe and the US would never ever support terrorists, though, but they will support the Syrian Rebels, the Ukraine Rebels (maybe) and so on... Whether you think it's right or wrong, it all comes down to supporting people who are fighting your enemies.
Say you have a box of Legos with 500 pieces. With those 500 pieces, you build a bulldozer. Then one day, you decide to rearrange those pieces from a bulldozer to a monster truck. It's still the same 500 pieces, just in a different layout. This is how trees are formed. The matter is just rearranged from other objects. Soil, nutrients, water, and even air. This is called "Conservation of Mass." EDIT: added air. Thanks. :)
Let's say your mom wants to make a cake. She can get all the individual ingredients or get a pre-made mix. Programming languages are like the pre-made mix. They were created using lower-level languages, all the way down to binary itself. You could write your program with binary, but it would take a long time and be much more difficult for you to remember. The pre-made cake mix already has the ingredients needed to make a cake. You just add water (or maybe an egg). Programming in a high-level language, although sometimes difficult to grasp at first, is much easier that memorizing sequences of 0's and 1's.
I played 1 and 2 so I'll try to explain, here it goes... *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* Andrew Ryan was a man who believed that there shall be no rulers, only men. This idea led him to build an underwater city where artisans and scientists could live and prosper, advancing like never before, without impedance. The city was named "Rapture". It was all good for a time, until the scientists discovered these sea slugs that produced "Adam", a psychoactive and mutating drug. It was eventually used to make plasmids which were injections that gave you super human powers and tonics which granted perks. Then, shit went down...way down. They needed a way to recycle the Adam from dead people so they abducted little girls (5-6yo's) and implanted them with a sea slug. They would meander around with large syringes and stab bodies to draw blood. They lived in an ignorant haze and thought the people were "angels". People tried to steal the "Little Sisters" for their own Adam gain so men were drafted and grafted into large diving suits to follow the sisters and protect them with their lives. They're "Big Daddies". Andrew couldn't have children so he had an embryo created. A super criminal stole this, programmed it to grow hyper-fast, leave rapture and grow up, come back, and kill Ryan. You're the embryo. You board a plane and kill the pilot, crashing near the island to enter rapture via bathysphere. You traverse rapture, find all this out, and kill the super criminal and Ryan (by his own request). If you saved all the little sisters, you get the ending where you help them escape and they grow up and have lives and come to you when you grow old and die. If you killed them, you take what you want and leave them there. That's the first game. It's a dystopian first person shooter with a very eerie and dark tone. It's very sea-oriented and is placed in the 50's. In 2, you're a big daddy who used to be a famous diver which was kidnapped and turned into a big daddy after he found rapture(10 years after the first game) You're awakened by something and struggle to survive the city once again. Now, "(Dr.) Elanor Lamb" is in charge and has a large cult following. You're an alpha series big daddy so you were bonded with your little sister as an experiment. She and you can't get far away or you die. She can also mentally contact you. She is now grown up and is(and always was) the daughter of lamb. She is helping you find her and you do and blah blah blah fight scene....you two escape and she releases you into the water because you die on the way up. It's heart breaking and I hate watching the ending because of that. You should play 1 and 2 before infinite, seriously. I'm not kidding. You'll have a better experience. You should consult wikipedia for a more detailed recounting of the campaigns.
There is no real intuitive explanation of HOW it happens, but here is how they came up with it Okay, so years ago Galileo came up this idea called relativity. Basically he said that Newton's Laws are valid in all inertial reference frames, that is ones that are not accelerating. So what this means is that if I'm in a car going a constant 20mph and a car is approaching me at 30mph, we could assume that MY car is standing still and their's is approaching at 50mph. At the time what he was really saying is "The laws of physics are valid in all inertial reference frames," as Newton's laws were, more or less the laws of physics as far as we knew. So in come a few people: Gauss, Ampere, and Faraday who develop some really important laws governing electricity and magnetism. A fellow named Maxwell expands on their work and realizes that--with some tweaking--their results combine to four very elegant laws explaining how charged bodies move and how magnets work, also that they are very closely linked (you've probably heard the term *electromagnetism*, yes we physicists view them as two sides of the same coin). Maxwell combines their results into a set of laws called "Maxwell's Equations." One of the equations implies that changes in a magnetic field create and electric field and vice-versa. One of the RESULTS of Maxwell's equations is that light travels at a constant speed, which we could now calculate with these equations. Now in come the quantum physicists of the early 20th Century. They realize that light is a just a propagating change in the electric and magnetic fields. So Einstein wonders, "if light is just the electric and magnetic fields changing, what would happen if we 'ran' next to light at the same speed? We don't see the changes in the field (aka the light) and there should be no light when we run alongside it (this is a clumsy way of saying with words what he said with math)." So Einstein is REALLY perplexed by this. Next he thinks "If all the laws of physics were the same in all inertial frames back in Galileo's day, why shouldn't the same be true for Maxwell's equations." Remember that from Maxwell we can DERIVE the speed of light. So Einstein decides THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS A LAW OF THE UNIVERSE. That is, no matter how fast we move, light moves at the same speed! That takes a moment to digest so think about it. Say I'm running away from you at 5mph and you're standing still. A photon (light particle) runs between us; WE BOTH SEE IT MOVING AT THE SAME SPEED! Now what is speed? It is distance over time. You saw the photon move some distance X, I saw it move some distance that was more than X. But we saw it move at the same speed! How is that possible? If and only if a clock in my pocket was ticking slower than a clock in your pocket! Edit: Let me say explicitly, **the faster you are moving, the slower a clock moving at the same speed will tick.** Also, grammar. Physics man...
They're largely encapsulated in your nice, warm head, and receive a pretty continuous supply of blood from your core, which provides them heat. As well, your tears, being salty, are somewhat more resistant to freezing.
Americans like to pretend this would offend their morals while basically being bereft of actual morals that matter.
There is a ted talk on this. It's about [primal posture]( URL_0 ). In short, it's because of our furniture. From when we are babies, our posture is encouraged to slouch, like in car seats. Pelvis tilted in and rounded forward shoulders. This continues through our lives, in our couches and regular chairs. So it is difficult to train your body to sit properly, when it has been doing something else it's whole life. In the talk she mentions, societies in non-developed areas, they sit and stand properly. Since they were from birth sitting and standing optimally, thanks to not having furniture encouraging bad posture.
Fun side note: when you drown, your lungs don't fill up with water until after you're dead. Your trachea clamps shut to prevent water from entering your lungs, then you run out of oxygen, then you die and water seeps in.
Just because those aspects are valued by the culture, it doesnt mean the need for perverse and absurd things go away. If anything, the cultural repression of those things make the need for them even higher.
Nowadays, traffic lights are red with a hint of orange and green with a hint of blue, so that red/green colorblind people can distinguish clearly.
They're starting to. Note that you'll hear them named less often rather than playing their name and face everywhere. Hopefully the trend continues, but salaciuos news stories that drive ratings sell advertising.
There are two big reasons: Infrastructure and Monopolies/greed. America is huge. Really huge. I hear it's hard for some Europeans to even comprehend its size, considering there's a couple STATES that all of England could fit into. From tip of Maine to coast of California is almost a week of driving 14+ hours/day, if not more. This means in order for a company to build up a strong network across the country takes a lot of time, manpower, and money. So it's hard for any new companies to form, because forming new infrastructure is a MASSIVE investment which takes a really long time to recover from. Why not just upgrade the existing infrastructure then? Well, that's where point two comes in. Because the infrastructure is so expensive, there's only so much of it to go around, and only a handful of companies big enough to manage it all. Comcast, AT & T, Verizon, to name a few, own the vast majority of the cables that make up the internet in America. The onus is on them to perform these upgrades. In fact, the government even gave them money to do just that. Instead of delivering on the promise of "We'll take this money and build infrastructure", they used some legal trickery to end up pocketing most of it, while not upgrading the networks nearly as much as they should have. So you've got these companies that own existing infrastructure that refuse to upgrade it. The market should dictate that someone willing to come in and perform those upgrades could compete, right? Well, turns out the cable companies have agreements in place where they won't compete in certain regions. In cases where they don't, they even get local governments to sign agreements saying they won't let their competitors come in and build new infrastructure to compete with them (usually in exchange for a few years of cheap rates for their community). So now you have existing, mediocre infrastructure with no way to compete against it without building an entirely new network. You can see how this monopoly would be hard to break. There's also a whole lot of politics involved. The FCC is in charge of managing communications networks in America, and they tend to be very hit or miss. I don't have a lot of details handy, but there's plenty of information out there if you're interested in how these companies are getting away with what they're doing. Pretty much our only hope of salvation at this point is Google. They're (slowly) building a fiber optic network, with speeds that far and away surpass even the most expensive consumer level plans at the other ISPs. It's not really clear at this point if their goal is to truly build a stronger internet for the whole country, or if they're just trying to scare ISPs into actually upgrading to speeds that are acceptable. In Googles eyes, I don't think they care, as long as the network improves, because a lot of their services (youtube, their data processing, etc) require high bandwidth that the current infrastructure can't really support. Personally, I hope to hell that they expand their fiber network across the country and we finally have real, true competition to shop from. Here's to hoping it's not just a pipe dream :/
Because all that red blood leaves your face when your body thinks it’s in danger and goes to your chest where all the important stuff is. Your hands get white too.
I've been lead to believe our eyes play a part in this from my optometrist. I'm left eye dominant which means I *should* be left handed. But since my grandmother "encouraged" me by smacking my left hand anytime I tried to use it to not be lefty I am right handed. To be fair my grandmother is very old and where she grew up left handedness is a sign of the devil so that's what prompted her to change me. Superstition.
So your internet data packets travel roughly 30% of the speed of light. That means, roughly 100,000 kilometers per second. So if you want to have ping of less than 20 ms, that is, 0.02 seconds, route from you to the server and back needs to be less than 0.02s * 100,000km/s = 2,000km. So if you live within 1000km of the server, you can achieve ping of 20ms, at least, in theory. There are some extra troubles here. Server can't respond to you instantly, it takes some time to figure out what kind of response you want. Also you have some processing to do on your end as well, drawing a single frame takes about 10 milliseconds from your gpu, and also non-gaming displays can have like 20ms delay between fame being ready to be shown on your computer, and the frame being actually shown. But anyhow, if you are within 1000km of the server, you should be seeing whatever server wants to show you within 0.1 seconds of you requesting this information. This to a human is almost unnoticeable delay. If the distance grows however, ping becomes more and more significant factor in causing delay, and at about 0.3s, it's very close to impossible to not notice this delay. So that's the basics of physics behind this. So how do games do this? A typical solution is that there is a central server, as before, which has something called "tick rate". Every tick, the server sends a packet describing what the server thinks the game world is like. Your computer then displays this world, and if you move or do something else in the game, your computer sends this data to server and once server receives your actions, it includes these in the next tick it composes. I know Valve games use tick rate of 64 ticks per second. Which is sort of nice, but if your actions have to go through server to be shown to you, this means there is distinct feeling of lack of control that can cause things like nausea if the delay between actions you make and these actions being shown on screen grows too large. So games typically cheat a bit. They try to guess what the server is thinking at the moment, and incorporate your own actions onto game world immediately. This means what you're being shown isn't actually the world as server tick describes it, but prediction like "if the last tick was sent 15ms ago(taking network lag into account) and said the world looks like that, what would the game world look like now, 15ms later?" So there are two closely linked game worlds your computer tries to keep in sync. Which usually works fine, but sometimes these worlds go off sync because of too much lag. This causes things like characters stuttering, warping around the map, things like that. But if everything works fine, your computer is able to make rather reasonable predictions about what's gonna happen next and these guesses and actual ticks stay in sync, so the game looks butter smooth to you even with about 100ms lag or something like that as game draws based on these predictions rather than waiting for server to confirm anything, and only after the fact it makes sure everything went as intended. If not, these sudden corrections are what cause warping, as your computer has to very fast fix position from predicted position to where the server tells that object actually is at. Lots of these kinds of corrections and everything just warps and stutters around your screen. With voice communications, lag can become much higher before you start noticing the delay. You probably would not notice 1 second delay on a voice chat that easily.
It's not a crime to kill someone in a car wreck if it was genuinely an accident. According to wikipedia:  > In July 2015, Los Angeles investigators determined that while Jenner was inattentive, "she was not intoxicated or texting" before the crash, and would not face felony charges.[77]
There is not a huge market for chinese restaurant decorations so there are limited manufacturers of decorations and menu photos. Everyone buys from the same supplier and they all end up looking the same. Similar to the blue greek Anthora cups that are served everywhere in NYC or how every frat party uses red solo cups despite frat parties not being franchises. Hundreds of frat party planners go to hundreds of stores and end up making the same decision. Red solo cups are the right price and size for a party. So everyone looks the same because they are all making the same decision despite being different people.
You have to trick your audience into seeing the illusion of depth, since all you really have to work with is height and width. This was a much slower process. You can see the eventual progressions of depth in the Greek painting on their [older paintings](  URL_0 ). You can see in this painting, unlike the Egyptian paintings that we get some sort of illusion of depth. People are now standing behind things. Our humans are still very flat, but painters are slowly getting the hang of it. By the Roman era, we'd gotten pretty good with giving the face some depth. [This]( URL_3 ) is a memorial painting found in Egypt around the Roman Empire period. Unlike the more flat featured Greek paintings, we have more definition of the human face. It still looks a bit cartoony, but it is an improvement. Jumping forward to the Middle Ages, skills are progressing to a point where the artists understand the need for depth, but they are not quite sure how to do it. [Here]( URL_4 ) is a good example. The painting seems "off" doesn't it? That's because there is no common vanishing point. The right side of the painting seem to be aligned with a vanishing point wanting to happen in the deep left of the picture. But the left side has vanishing points all over the place. Roof slants, walls and windows are places helter skelter. We're getting closer to realism though. As far as humans go, painters are getting closer as well. [Here]( URL_1 ) is a young woman. Notice, we have a lot more details now than we did back with the Greeks. It's not just a side profile of the face, but now we can get it at an angle. To our eyes, things still look off. The size of her face to the size of her head is seriously out of proportion as is her head to her body. But, we have depth. By the time the Renaissance rolled around, humans had pretty much cracked the code of proportion, depth and vanishing points. Da Vinci's famous [Last Supper]( URL_2 ) is one of the best uses of the Vanishing Point, drawing all of our attention to the center where Christ is. Michelangelo understood anatomy and proportion to give us convincing people in his [paintings](  URL_5 ). It's a really rough explanation of a fairly complicated topic, but hopefully that is enough of an over view. It just took a lot of people a long time to learn how to do it, since all information back then was just transferred from master to student and they built on the previous person's knowledge. EDIT: Crosspost from a similar question I answered in r/askhistorians. Thanks, /u/Dubuious_Squirrel !
My guess wild carrots, parsnips, potatoes, radishes, burdock, salsify, beets, native ginger, earthnut, varieties of yams and sweet potato etc.
Underage actors have far more regulations regarding when they can work and how often; those regulations are intended to protect child actors, but it means that it's just easier to work with older actors. In addition, older actors just have more experience and and are generally more convincing on screen; think about how terrible the acting is on, say, Disney Channel, where most of the actors are actually about the same age as the characters they're portraying, compared to most movies where you have actors in their twenties playing high school kids.
Right over there. Unfortunately, I do not have the ability to point in the direction I'm trying to indicate. And, unfortunately, neither you nor I have sense organs optimized to perceive the direction I'm trying to indicate. But if we had those abilities, I could point you in the right direction - right over there. You might consider reading *Flatland*. For a quick summary, imagine a 2-dimensional being - a square. It has no ability to point or look up or down because its limbs and sense organs are entirely 2-dimensional. Everything it knows and understands occupies this 2-dimensional plane. Now imagine a 3-dimensional being - a sphere - happily going through 3-dimensional space and it spots this cool 2-dimensional plane like a tabletop with lots of 2-dimensional shapes moving around "on" it. The sphere decides to pass through the plane just for fun and the square sees something very weird: a point that expands into a circle and then shrinks away to a point and then is gone. It's like magic. It makes no sense. Now the sphere decides it would be fun to pick up the square and lift it out of the plane it occupies. It does so and the square is aware only that the world has disappeared and been replaced to its sense organs as weird things never sensed before. Terrifying. Now the sphere tips the square. The square is suddenly able to see *inside* other 2-dimensional beings. As the tipping continues, the square sees its world in a series of cross sections and (perhaps) could be taught by the sphere to recognize friends, family members, buildings, trees, etc. So very, very bizarre. Now the sphere puts the square back on the plane where it was found and goes on its merry way up up and away. The square is left with a literally incredible experience. No ability to explain what just happened to it. Trying to indicate where it went and what it perceived is impossible - no one has language for the direction or perception. Now extend all this to a fourth dimension. A fifth. A sixth. There could be a 4-dimensional being "hovering" right "over" my shoulder watching me type this and looking inside me and this monitor... It might just decide it would be fun to pick me "up" and show me something I will be totally unable to describe to you afterwards. Even though all that happened is I went right over . . . there. Edit: Thank you so much, kind stranger, for the gold! Is there anything quite like the first time? Edit 2: Again, I really want to be clear that *Flatland* gets all the credit for this way of visualizing the problem. I just summed it up as ELI5 as I could.

This article explains the psychology behind laughter pretty well ...  URL_0  TL;DR Turns out, they aren't exactly 100% sure what actually causes laughter - but they do know we can't actually control when we laugh,  &  most times we laugh isn't because something is actually funny. We laugh for a lot of reasons, most of them have to do with how our brains evolved as humans. Their main point is that laughter is social  &  helps us bond with others around us. In inappropriate situations, it could just be your brain trying to cope with the tension  &  break up the awkwardness..
Only about 1 in 20,000 eggs in the US contain Salmonella so eating raw or under-cooked eggs it's minor calculated risk. In addition, the whites themselves are not very suitable for bacteria growth.
The idea is that if God is all powerful and created everything, that means he doesn't use his omnipotent powers to actually get rid of evil of the world (from genocide down to stubbing your tow on the coffee table). Thus, either God willfully lets' evil exist even if it's in his power to remove it (thus he isn't all good) or he physically cannot remove the evil from the world (thus he isn't all powerful). There have been many, MANY attempts to unravel this mess and make a logically consistent case where God is all powerful and all good but evil still exists in the world. [Here is a better explanation than I can provide]( URL_0 )
If you place a nuclear plant in the middle of nowhere you need expensive power transmission lines to connect it to the users. You also need to build trains and roads to the area for the construction. You may also need to make a factory for the concrete and steelworks close by. All the construction workers need a place to live and later you need places for the workers at the power plant to live. The logistics is a lot harder as you can not just pop out to the hardware store if you need something. In Soviet they did this for administrative purposes. The Chernobyl power plant had 50,000 people living in the nearest city and they only provided the power plant with workers and hardware.
You can separate the two elements with an electric current, a 9 volt battery is plenty. It is called electrolysis. Look it up and you can see how to make or buy a small apparatus to do it. Fill two test tubes with the resulting gasses and you can measure the volume of gas, showing that the hydrogen tube has twice the volume of the oxygen tube. You can test the properties of the gasses (explode the Hydrogen, use the Oxygen to make something burn brighter, etc.)
SO and partner can mean the same thing. But partner sounds more formal (IMO). I might be dating someone exclusively but that wouldn't necessarily make them my "partner". Partner makes it sound like we live together and that we're, well, partners. The phrase "SO" is wide enough to cover everything from "we're dating exclusively" to "we're married". And the word partner sounds sort of antiquated. I mean, it's not wrong! People use it and I have nothing against them. But it's not really hip -- and yes, I just exposed my lack-of-hipness by using the word hip.
Google started out at a PhD research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1996 accessible at  URL_0 . They registered  URL_3  in September 1997 as they started to realize that their research was valuable. Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, gave them $100,000 in August 1998 to continue to develop the search engine. User growth exploded in 1999 after  URL_1  wrote an article in December 1998 saying  URL_3  has the best search results. On June 7, 1999, they got $25 million in venture capital funding. It wasn't until 2000, after they'd built up a large user base, that they finally started selling advertisements. Source:  URL_2 
Because your body is used to it. if you slouch all the time and then try and sit up straight, you're forcing seldom used muscles to work. If you sit up straight all the time, slouching will hurt because your back muscles will stretch awkwardly in an unfamiliar way. If you sit for a long period of time, you'll probably be a little sore regardles, but more so if you're slouching, which puts pressure on your spinal nerves. when you'd sit straight all the time and have the muscles to support yourself, you realize that slouching actually doesn't feel that good. tldr slouching feels good because you haven't experienced truly comfortable sitting, maaaaaaan.
Tin foil loses its heat very quickly. It heats up fast, and cools down fast. Once you take it out of the oven/grill, the temperature starts dropping fast.
By replying, you're giving the spammers three pieces of valuable information. First, you're verifying that the email address they sent is a valid email address that is being checked. That has value to other spammers, making your email something they can sell. Second, you're verifying that their email message wasn't screened out by whatever anti-spam filters are in place. That shows the skill of the spammer's ability, making their services appear more valuable. Finally, by replying you're verifying that you have the psychology that reads these junk emails, and will from time-to-time, respond to unsolicited messages, which makes you an appealing target for future efforts.
It is pretty much Christians who feel that Christ is being taken out of Christmas by people who say things like Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas. They feel that Christmas is about Jesus etc and people of other religions/holidays should just accept this.
This is something I did with my 5 year old daughter: We took an ice cube tray and filled it with water. We put in in the freezer and talked about how it was going to get cold, and I asked her what she thought would happen. Then we took the ice out and put it in a pan on the stove. We talked about how it was going to warm up, and I asked what she thought would happen. When it was all liquid, we talked about how it was still getting warmer. What will happen next. And when the pan was dry, we talked about where the water went. A few days later she is asking what are clouds. So we talked about where the water in the pot had gone. I asked her what she thought would happen when the water cooled down. She said "it will be a liquid again," and just then it started raining. So I asked her what she thought would happen if it got really cold. Ice, snow. Having a curious kid is fun.
When you stream a song on Spotify or a similar service, they must pay the record company (or whoever owns the rights to the song) a royalty fee. Depending on the band and how much clout they have, this royalty amount varies, but its usually fractions of a cent. However, when someone purchases a song on iTunes, for example, the rights owner is paid 70% of the sale price (69 cents for $0.99 songs and 90 cents for $1.29 songs). And therefore, in order for an artist to make as much off a song streaming on Spotify as they do off a sale on iTunes, someone has to listen to it perhaps upwards of 100 times, depending on their payout from the streaming service. TL;DR: the payout from 1 song stream on Spotify is fractions of a cent where buying that song on iTunes yields 70-90 cents for the owner of the rights to the song. Some artists hope people will buy their music if they can't stream it.
Hi, I'm one of the creators of this bot. There a link to a post I wrote on how the bot works with each replay it gives, but here is also a post from r/technology where I tried to explain it in a more simple way  URL_1  The original post:  URL_0  If there are any questions/suggestions let me know.
Originally, Holocaust deniers based their "reasoning" off three basic facts: • Lack of public access to physical evidence. At the end of WWII, the remaining evidence regarding the Holocaust in Germany (that wasn't destroyed by the Nazis when they figured out they were going to be defeated) was effectively locked up — it was made accessible solely to academically credentialled researchers, in order to prevent it from being stolen, destroyed, gawked at, glorified, touristed, worshipped, etcetera. Germany took whatever steps they thought necessary to prevent Nazism from continuing — which included stamping it out from any sympathy or legitimacy. Which leads to: • Outlawing of non-academic criticism of the Holocaust and Nazism. It was a crime in Germany to question the official, academic account of the Holocaust, even when small amounts of evidence were debunked. This smells to many people like a cover-up of a fabricated story. • Lack of Germans willing to step forward publicly and claim that they witnessed part of the Holocaust. If one knew directly, firsthand of the crimes, and allowed them to happen — no-one *wants* to admit that. One could be prosecuted, be shunned, face retribution, be sued … Most people wanted to rebuild, not spend their lives wallowing in Hell. So there are very few survivors, very few survivors with direct knowledge, very few with any reason to speak out about it, very few with the academic credentials to do so. There is no money, and no academic legitimacy, in lending credence to holocaust deniers and treating them like their claims are legitimate, factually based, and worth addressing. Letting them set the agenda and decide what should be talked about in History and Academics regarding the Holocaust is effectively saying "Okay, you may have a point, please make it." It lends a veneer of respectability, a colour of legitimacy that they haven't earned. So the historians and academics and most political bodies do nothing more than say "well, babies poop their diapers too, but it isn't my job to wipe their bottoms." So the Holocaust deniers are effectively allowed to operate perpetuallyin an environment of drama — the same environment of drama that every cult and conspiracy research culture and underdog political movement operates in — the [Karpman Drama Triangle]( URL_0 ). There is a Persecutor, a Victim, and a Saviour. There is a struggle. This lends everyone involved a sense of purpose and meaning, and to many people, a sense of purpose and meaning for their life is much more important than treating others with fairness and respect, and the struggle is carefully calculated so it can never be resolved. That is their poopy diaper situation, which the academics decline to become involved in. The same narrative — that there is a Persecutor, a Victim, and a Saviour — was used very effectively by the Nazis in the first place, who cast the Jews as the Persecutor, the Germans as the Victims, and the Nazis as the Saviours. So of course, anyone buying that drama triangle must, by necessity, deny that the Jews were the victims of the Nazis, that the Nazis were the Persecutors, and that there was no saviour of the Jews. Even though the US and Britain and their allies knew of the Holocaust, and won the war, and Britain gave Palestinian territory to Israel to make a homeland for Jews that survived the war — there was no saviour. There were individual heroes that smuggled Jews to safety. There were those who sabotaged the Nazi efforts. But no-one in WWII was a saviour, no-one saved the world, no-one saved the Jews.
One of the reasons is that self-control is actually a resource that can be depleted. The brain has to expend more energy to exhibit self-control rather than just doing what it wants. Want to guess what form that energy takes? Glucose! That's right, sugar. So, when your sugar levels drop you actually have less ability to exhibit self-control. That's why it's a good idea to have your meals planned and prepared before you're insanely hungry because you won't have the self-control to stop yourself from going to McDonald's.
I've heard 2 explanations - can't vouch for either. 1. Wrist have a lot of blood flow near the skin and hence produce a lot of heat. Heat helps release the scent. 2. Wrists are an area that are likely to get closer to other people. Guess they also always exposed where much of the body isnt.
This topic has bubbled back up for me recently as many of my friends have popped out kids. The reality is, they don't *really* have all that much more energy than you do if you think about it logically (making assumptions that you approach parenting like many other people and are attempting to keep your children healthy). They have enforced bed times and they get the required and prescribed amount of sleep almost every night. They are well-rested every day. They don't sacrifice sleep to meet other goals. They almost never skip meals or eat poorly (your 4 year old won't skip a real breakfast and suck down some coffee and a danish because he's late for the train. He will instead eat the healthy breakfast you've made for him, while making yourself late for the train. You can always pick up a coffee and a danish on the way in to work, right?) In addition to eating three square meals every day, they are offered snacks at regular intervals. They have enforced nap times, usually at least once and sometimes twice per day. When was the last time you checked out for a 30 minute nap at work? How much more energy do you think you might have if you could? Finally, you approach a much more complex set of tasks over the course of a day; you must not only take care of yourself, but a 4 year old child. Additionally you'll need to hustle yourself to work, dedicate significant brainpower and/or physical labor to your job, make sure your household stays in order (pay bills, get groceries and other goods, etc.), and still take part in whatever social rituals you are involved in. Comparatively, (barring the mental and physical demands of growing up), your 4 year old is positively *relaxing*.
The female obviously. Being drunk doesn't absolve you from your actions. She is committing statutory rape, the fact that she's drunk makes no difference except maybe in the plea process.
If water becomes privatized basically it becomes a commodity like shoes, clothing brands, cars, etc. Only those who can afford it will have access. Now this isn't a big deal for most commodities, if you can't afford a pair of Nikes there is a cheap brand, knock off or warehouse sales for clothes, public transportation if you don't have a car but water is pretty different as it is literally essential to a healthy life, or any life at all for that matter. If water becomes privatized, it might not be an issue for 1st world citizens like us at first, though privatized water systems have infrastructure issues, most people would still be able to afford it at first though. In third world countries though, and eventually in 1st world, there will come a time where not everyone will be given access to water and this is when things will turn bad. I truly think that water will be the focus of some major conflicts in the relatively near future. This isn't some comfort issue, this isn't some superfluous need, this is water. You will fucking die in a day or two without any water and that's if it's clean. People have been rioting all over the world for far less, if you take away something so essential to life you can damn well be they'll fight for that. TL;DR War and in my opinion the possible destruction of society could result from the privatization of water.
It's long enough for a company to replace you, but also short enough for the employee to wrap up any truly urgent things, say their goobyes, not have to deal with (too much) hostility or coworker retaliation for quitting (if applicable). If an employee wants to quit, it's usually because they're not satisfied with their workplace or they found a better position elsewhere (which implies the current position is unsatisfactory in comparison). Dissatisfaction often means reduced productivity, so it's a good thing for an employer to only have to keep them that extra 2 weeks. Plus, if an employee feels their workplace does deserve more than 2 weeks, nothing prevents them from hinting around beforehand or even working with the employer to ensure a better transition.
It's not actually that much more common for priests than anyone else. The controversy comes from the churches trying to cover up the scandal and protect their priests/pastors. It's also a little more sensational, because religious leaders are often trusted with children.
The Egyptians were the first to split the full cycle of day and night up into 24 hours, a system that was later improved upon by Greek astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus who further split it up in a sexagesimal (60 as a base) system, and that's where the second comes into play. First you divide an hour into 60 parts, creating the minute, and then you divide that a *second* time, hence the name, creating 1/60th of a minute. Further splitting up a second in sixthieths is called a third, but that's not really used nowadays. At the time it wasn't possible to keep time that accurate, but towards the end of the 16th century mechanical clocks were able to measure seconds accurately, which is also when the English word for them came into use. **Edit: Since so many people ask "Why use 60 as a base?", the answer is because it's easy to divide it by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12 15, 20 and 30, making it a solid base for counting.**
It really doesn't. The trouble with battery advice is that people keep repeating stuff that was written for entirely different battery types several decades ago. Sometimes they even refer to the "memory effect", which is something that which only applied to NiCD (a battery type that's been almost completely extinct for more than a decade and isn't used in phones or laptops), a very particular type of them at that (so not nearly all of them), and required such a regular usage pattern to reproduce that it's not seen outside of laboratories and satellites. Yeah, overcharging batteries is bad. But given that lithium tends to explode or light itself on fire when abused, and that it costs companies big $$$ and it makes the news when anything of the sort happens... a bad lithium charger is pretty much nonexistent outside of really cheap junk from China.
The other answers are overcomplicated and not entirely correct. Basically a cisgender person is someone who self-identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth. In even simpler terms: if your birth certificate said either male or female and now that you're old enough to consider it, you basically agree with that, then you are cisgender. The rage is about a bunch of people saying that what you think you are doesn't matter, only the gender assigned at your birth is truly important.
E-mail is sent using a protocol called SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) which dates back to 1981 (and so is about eight years older than the World Wide Web). Back then, the internet was used by the military and academia (universities, research institutions and so on) -- it wasn't available to the general public. Nobody really thought the internet would become what it is now, with nearly everyone in the developed world (and a lot of people in the developing world) owning devices that could connect to it. And the idea that anyone would want to spoof e-mails was... ridiculous. This was a serious research tool, a network of databases. So SMTP never included a way to authenticate the sender. And we're stuck with that.
Because they count on some people not showing up, and they didn't guarantee you a seat on that flight. You bought a ticket and they will get you there, on a different flight if necessary.
Like everyone else is saying, Christians are opposed to homosexuality because it says so in the Bible. First of all, it undermines the original design of humanity, with Adam and Eve. You see this in Leviticus, but maybe that stuff's too extreme and hardcore, which is understandable (maybe not the best context to use the term "hardcore", but we'll go with it). Even in the New Testament, we see Paul in his letters to the Church of Corinth and to the Romans, talking about how homosexual acts bring people away from God (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Romans 1:26-28). However, I'd also like to take this opportunity to provide further insight, maybe biased, coming from a Christian. While the Bible does indeed state that homosexuality is a sin, one of Jesus' greatest commandments was to "Love your neighbor as yourself." The Ten Commandments state that anyone with hatred or anger commits murder in their heart. That being said, I believe that someone identifying as homosexual is no basis for being opposed to them. If anything, it is the opposite. Jesus showed no discrimination during his time on Earth in who he chose to help and heal. By nature, we are all sinners, none more or less than others, so there is no reason why homosexuals should be treated any differently, because we are all in need of the same saving grace that comes in Jesus Christ. Maybe I'm putting myself on the chopping block here, but I'd claim that a lot of the Christians you hear about who are protesting and rioting (ex: Westboro Baptist, but as /u/IvyGold reminded me, I'd definitely question even calling them a church. It's a very extreme example) have a bit of a twisted idea of the message of Christianity. Jesus' teachings, and the whole story of the gospel - that is, God sending his only son to die in our place - revolve around love. "Faith, hope, and love. The greatest of these is love." (1 Corinthians 13:13). As a Christian, a follower of Jesus and a son of God, I would not be living as a Christian if I did not reflect the same love that God shows me when he saves. TL;DR: Christians are opposed to homosexuality, in the sense that the Bible states that homosexuality is a sin, and sin is bad, but Christians are the same broken and sinful people as everyone else, which means that Christians are not better people or on a higher level, and are out of place to judge people because of their sexuality. Edit: I apologize, that came out to be a lot longer than I anticipated. But I do hope that my words help shed some light. Edit: I suppose now I'm obligated to thank some people for the gold. So thanks! I'm sorry to say, however, that I have no clue what it does or what it allows me to do. This was the first time I logged on to reddit in over a year, and, quite honestly, this will probably go to waste. I wish I could hand it off to someone else who could have better use of it. Without paying for it, of course.
There is no 'non-isotopic' element,only one isotope which is the most abundant. The periofic table values are there to be used for calculations in relation to how many moles of a substance you have. In nature you will never get a sample of an element which is isotopically pure so it makes more sense to adjust the molecular massses to be a weighted average of all the isotopes in the element relative to 1/12 of the mass of C12.
Any kind of scratching noises attract them because it sounds like a mouse. Getting low to the ground makes you less threatening and smaller - notice how they run away when you stand up at your full height. Holding your fingers out makes you less threatening because they can come close and smell you to learn your scent, and by staying at the limit of your reach they're safe from being picked up suddenly.
I don't know much about the army, but I do watch TV! I imagine it's because the navy/army/air force is best suited to the mission. For example, a navy seals team would take on a operation that requires access by water, the army would use helicopters to transport troops to a dense urban/jungle zone, the airforce would go to different planets through the star gate.

Theoretically, the human body has finite limits that it cannot exceed. Bones can take only so much force without breaking, the human circulatory system has limits due to size, etc... However, there can always be outliers that are genetically better suited than the average human for certain sports. So in other words, we could plateau, but someone better could always be born to break the record.
These unions are powerful because they represent people whose careers are widely respected and critical. And any kind of strike/industrial action/work stoppage is a **big deal**. If police go on strike, we instantly live in a more dangerous world. And if teachers go on strike, it has an immediate negative effect on the economy as many people will have to stay home with children who otherwise would be at work. As a result, keeping these unions happy is a key public policy priority.
In principle the looting of bodies is frowned upon, so "allowed" is probably not the right word. Scavenging is ok, looting is not. Collecting enemy weapons could be considered scavenging, removing and collecting their gold teeth would be looting.
Guy who works in a sleep clinic here. I score many sleep studies (heck, I was just scoring some a few minutes ago). And position of sleep is something that I check on every study. Why do I check? Because no matter what people say or think they do, they often move a lot. Are there people who don't sleep on their side or back? Sure. But they are rare, and even they often to it because they have some kind of issues (e.g. back pain in supine). You probably start on your side, and likely spend most of the time there. But there is a strong chance you spend at least some of the time on your back. If you don't and you snore and you often wake up tired, you may want to consider seeing a doctor about possible sleep apnea (this disorder is worse on the back).

It is really just the humidity and temperature that makes the air feel "thick" or less oxygen saturated. In addition, more humid air can transport its temperature better and more humid air smells more. That's why dogs can smell stuff better on rainy days. The CO2 level is not noticeable different. There was a video about a guy in a chamber where they lowered the oxygen level slowly. And the guy had to put a oxygen mask on when he notices. He didn't notice anything. Someone had to put it on him. Can't find the video.. And sorry for my bad English
1) They last for around a decade. The per-day use price is very low. 2) It's one of the highest profit margins in the furniture industry. 3) It's impossible to comparison shop. The manufacturer's can, and often do, "label" the exact same bed with a different cover and name for two stores in the same market area. 4) The used market is practically non-existent. It's like selling your used underwear. Nobody wants your filth. So everyone buys new every time. 5) There are only a handful of suppliers for the basic ingredients for a mattress. Legget  &  Platt, for example, supply almost all the metal involved for the approximately 1,000 U.S. mattress companies. Latex is made by two major companies. 6) Consumers buy when they need, not when they want. This makes a mattress set more of a last minute purchase, than say a car. 7) There are limited sources online to understand the build of a mattress. Therefore consumers have no idea what they are sleeping on. Most people could not imagine a visual of what it would look like if they sliced their bed open. Source: Another post on Reddit. :)
When sweat and bacteria accumulate in skin folds, it stinks. Particularly once yeast gets invited to the party. It happens to everyone, but it's harder to keep those areas clean and dry when you're morbidly obese.
It would depend on what is causing the hallucinations. Hallucinations from magic mushrooms are the result of psilocybin, the chemical in the mushrooms, suppressing the barriers between different regions of the brain. This allows crosstalk to occur within the brain. The senses get overloaded, and you see patterns, colours, and distorted reality. Source:  URL_0

When the original development company went out of business, it sold the rights to that game to someone, either Valve/GoG or someone who's now licensing it to them. Sou while you may not anymore supporting the original developers, you're still supporting an environment where game licenses have value, and if the original developers are still making games, they can probably only do so because such an environment exists. It's not really any different from buying a current game: the actual developers of a game typically get *nothing* from actual game sales - the entire revenue goes to the publisher, who financed the development of the game beforehand. Publishers take on the risk of financing the development of a flop, and get the reward from selling a big success. Developers get a steady income without having to worry about whether the game will sell.
Beer (and wine and mead) come first. All other alcoholic beverages are products of refining (properly "distilling") the various beers into stronger mixtures. So to make vodka, for instance, one makes a potato mash, then ferments that mash into potato beer, then uses heat and condensation to separate the alcohol from the water, concentrating the beer into a liquor. So beer isn't "more important" as a comparison of equals, it's a predicate. So the invention of the wheel is more _significant_ than the invention of the tire, because you have to make the wheel _first_ and wrapping that wheel with padding makes it into a tire. Without the predicate the follow-on technology never happens. So without beer there are no other alcoholic beverages. In general the historians talking about this subject are talking about the "big three" - beer, wine, and mead - when they talk about the discovery of beer. Since wine needs specifically grapes, and mead needs the domestication of honey, while beer can be made from any grain or sugar in general, it's something of an understood generalization. There is far more beer-making land throughout the cradles of civilization than there is wine or mead producing land. So the beer is though to come before the domestication of bees for mead, the domestication of the grape for wine, the domestication and enrichment of fruit trees for cider. So the various grain beers was likely first and foremost, and certainly lead to the invention of the other alcohols. There is some evidence that it also lead to the domestication of yeasts and so the baking of leavened bread.
There is actually a concept called subitizing, that relates to identification of small numbers of things without the need to count. Most humans are good at doing this for about 4-5 objects, and apparently several other primates are far better at subitizing than humans are, and can do with up to 9-10 objects.  URL_0 
Emotionally healthy people emote with their eyes. When they smile, the outer corners of their eyes tend to wrinkle. They raise their eyebrows when they're happy to see you. They look around to see the world and to observe others. Their eyes, in other words, are "alive." Depressed people either don't feel these things, or spend so much time not feeling them that they lose touch with how they'd usually express them. A depressed person will smile with their mouth, but not their eyes. They won't move their gaze around to see the whole picture - they don't care. They basically use their eyes strictly as a tool to grab certain information and not trip over things. They might not even be paying attention with their eyes, or with any of their senses. They might point their eyes at you just so you'll think they're fine. In other words, their eyes are "dead."
Okay I spent like twenty minutes trying to explain it like I would to a five year old, and I failed, so here it is as simply as possible. First off, you're kind of asking the wrong question. You have to remember that Wall St firms spend billions of dollars lobbying politicians to write laws that benefit them. So, for instance, financial derivatives were largely unregulated- there were very few laws governing them, and they are considered a main cause of the financial crisis. Some people argue that the people on Wall St didn't break any laws, but it's kind of a moot point. They're the ones who wrote the laws, and they wrote them in such a way that they could legally screw their own investors. So whether they committed a "crime" or not doesn't really matter at some level. They still behaved in completely immoral ways that nearly led to the financial collapse of the global financial system, just to line their own pockets. Whether it was illegal or not, it was wrong. That being said, there was a lot of behavior that many people would consider fraud at many levels of the financial system. The collapse was driven mainly by mortgage backed securities. Basically, back in the day, if you wanted a loan to buy a house, you'd go to your bank and they'd give you a loan to buy your house, and then you'd pay them back over twenty or thirty years. They had a lot of interest in making sure you could pay your loan back, because if you didn't they were out of a ton of money. With the invention of mortgage back securities, banks would make a loan to you, and then immediately sell it to an investment firm, which would package it with thousands of other mortgages, and then resell them to investors. Because the banks were only holding onto the loans for a short time period before they sold them, they didn't really care if you could pay back the loan or not. So they lent money to people who blatantly couldn't afford it. People who listed their occupation as "waitress" and their annual income as "$200,000." It was obvious the loan applicants were lying, but the banks let them because all they cared about was making a loan so they could sell it. And, yep, it was definitely criminal of the people who lied on their loan applications, but the banks have a legal responsibility to ensure the loan applications seem reasonably accurate (e.g., by requesting salary verification, calling your employer, whatever). The banks knew they were making bad loans, and then they represented them as good loans. Most people would consider that fraud. The investment banks who bought and packaged the mortgages also knew they were bad, and that they would likely fail. They did a couple things that appear to most people as fraudulent. First, it appears they colluded with the rating agencies so that the rating agencies would say these packages of mortgages were a very, very safe investment, when there's evidence (e.g., internal emails) that both the rating agencies and the investment banks knew they were not safe investments. Second, they encouraged their investors to buy these mortgage backed securities, claiming that they were a great investment, while at the same time they placed bets that these investments would actually fail. Some people argue this wasn't illegal, they were just hedging their financial position. However, again there are emails in which bankers are nicknaming these mortgage backed securities things like "doomed to fail" and "crap investment," while at the same time pushing them on their investors who they are supposed to be advising. Most people would consider that fraud, too.
Legal precedent comes from a court which can overturn the judge's ruling. If a judge ignores a precedent, then that judge's ruling will be overturned. If it keeps happening, he or she will end up angering a bunch of colleagues and, depending on the local rules, might get fired. If the judge at least makes good arguments as to why a precedent is wrong or doesn't apply in a particular case, then it's usually considered just fine to not apply precedent. Of course, people, including other judges, will differ on their opinion of what is a 'good argument'.
By pushing a lot of buttons. No, really, once a popular game gets out into the wile and has a lot of people playing it, the odds of a rare event (edit) **not** happening approach zero. Infinite monkeys on typewriters and all that. Another way is through reverse engineering. Coders and crackers analyze the object code and data assets of the game. Fundamentally, this all has to be presented to the computer or console (which are just computers now a days). If you control the computer, you can look for buried treasure. Say you're walking through a particular section of code that has to do with.... checking the location of the player in GTA. You notice a strangely specific sequence of conditionals (if statements), that check to see if the player is next to a movie theater, it's the right time, and he hasn't gone on a killing rampage. If all that's true, it jumps to another special section of code and back. That code is complex and loads stuff. Well, you fire up the game, go to that place at that time and watch what happens. Turns out Woody Allen makes a cameo. OR WHATEVER. Reverse engineering looks at the guts of the programming to find hidden details. It's made hard by the fact that it's in a very low-level language made to be read by machines and not people.
1) That would interrupt airflow 2) Damage to it could cause the metal to get sucked into the engine, much more destructive than a bird 3) A bird impaled on the mesh would still certainly interrupt clean airflow 4) It would add weight. Even a single pound of additional weight is lost fuel efficiency, amounting to quite a lot of money over the lifetime of the plan. EDIT: 5) Such grating would only be effective at relatively low speeds; once the jet gets going the bird will smash right through it anyway (credit /u/Dr_Evil_Powers)
There can be a very slight innate difference from race to race, but it's more to do with culture and accent than physiology - although physiology can sometimes play a part. However most likely if you heard a black guy who was, say, dutch or portuguese, you wouldn't be able to tell his race. To make another example, Phil Lamarr is a black guy who's a prolific voice actor, if you didn't know who he was you'd never be able to tell the color of his skin. However I've noticed it's very difficult for white guys to do convincing voices of black characters. Edit: Come to think of it, Phil Lamarr's normal voice doesn't sound like any particular race. Watch some interviews of him and see for yourself.
The Bank sells your house, probably taking the first low-ball offer they get. They are paid, and you get the rest of the money. If you're in this situation, selling it yourself is probably (almost always) a better idea.
"“Our whole system is based on personal trust,” an exasperated Clapper said, adding that there were no “mousetraps” in place to guarantee there wouldn’t be another Edward Snowden. The NSA has enacted tighter restrictions on when and how agents can access classified documents since Snowden’s heist, including a “two-man rule” requiring two administrators to work jointly when dealing with certain files."
Changing shirts is an issue of hygiene. Shirts get dirty faster. Food can fall on them. Bodily fluids. etc, etc get on your nice cotton shirts. If you wear the same shirt for 3 days straight it will start to smell and get gross. A pair of jeans on the other hand, if you measure bacteria and dirt when you start wearing them, and then measure a month later very little has changed. Sweat itself is effectively odorless to humans, the smell from BO comes from the bacteria eating proteins in your sweat. You have two types of glands Eccrine glands which just secrete sweat . Their only job is temperature regulation. Apocrine glands secrete sweat with shit in it on the other hand, namely the proteins the bacteria love eating to make shit smell. They are scent glands, where pheromones likely come out and influence social interaction. You find these glands in the armpit, around the nipples and near the groin. So two of these scent sweat glands sweat into a shirt, the other into your underwear - both areas where clothing is generally thought of as needing to be changed daily. Your thighs on the other hand just produce light sweat, effectively just water with salt in it. Bacteria aren't interested, so you just end up being sweaty rather than smelly. tl;dr - the sweat glands in your armpits produce scent based sweat with proteins in that bacteria eat. The byproduct of them eating protein is a bad smell. Washing and replacing your shirt gets rid of this smell. Sweat glands in your legs just produce water with salt which doesn't attract bacteria and thus does not smell.
One problem with a world-wide currency is neatly demonstrated by Greece and the Euro. One major way that a country can deal with hard times is to allow, or even force, their currency to be worth less. That makes the things you, as a country, make cheaper, and things you buy from other countries more expensive. So the country loses less money paying for exports, and makes more money selling its now cheaper exports. They can also create new money to pay for government spending, creating employment and pulling the country back onto its feet. If there is only one currency, a country can't do this. Their citizens keep buying imports, and their exports remain too expensive, and they can't recover without cutting back hard on government spending, which makes the hard times worse.
The idea is that gluten sensitivity and intolerance, with reactions less strong than normal Coeliac or Crohn's symptoms, are much more common than most people realise. Because there are differing levels of sensitivity to certain proteins and chemicals, particularly in food, many people may have health issues related to their gluten consumption that have gone undiagnosed throughout their lives. For example, one study on people who had recurring migraines (n=10, so not hugely definitive) found that 7 of them had a significant decrease in their migraine symptoms after excluding gluten from their diets. Other symptoms of gluten sensitivity or intolerance are believed to include non-migraine headaches, sinus congestion, digestive issues that don't have the same characteristics as Crohn's or Coeliac disease, unexplained weight loss (or gain, according to some people), lethargy, and even Gluten Ataxia. Another school of thought is loosely based on the Paleo/Primal diet and lifestyle, and holds that humans are not evolved to eat as much grains and beans as we do now, and the presence of gluten allergies, sensitivity and intolerances in our population is a sign that we should ditch grains and legumes. Of course, it's becoming more widely known and understood, so a lot of people are going to get on board the bandwagon and potentially misunderstand the reasons behind some people's exclusion of gluten from their diets.
it starts by the chef choosing which fish to buy from the market. is it a good fish? a great fish? what parts of the fish are good. what parts are great? once the fish gets to restaurant, how do you cut the fish? what angle do you cut it? what's the action of the knife cut? which parts of fish fit which dishes? alot of making sushi is in the making of the rice. what kind of rice are you using? how much water? what temperature? how long are you cooking? how much rice vinegar are you mixing in? how quickly are you cooling down? is the action that you're stirring in the rice making it more or less fluffy? sticky? chewy?
This is commonplace throughout Europe. We have high tax rates that enable a high quality of welfare provision. This extends to free or low cost medical and dental care, housing, and cost of living benefits. The answer to why is because these societies have decided that the expense of helping people through rough patches is worth it in the long term. It can help reduce crime, keep people out of worse poverty, which saves health costs further down the line. Or they just support it on moral grounds. Or a mix and match combination of factors.
It's a common misconception that people think that others care about what they eat. They don't. Please stop it.
This only affects somewhere between 30 and 40 percent of the population. But essentially, nerves connecting to your brain from your nasal area that can detect a tickle are crossed with your optic nerves. (I've heard the term crossed, can anyone confirm? ) so when you see bright light, your brain thinks it detects a tickle in your nasal passages. A sneeze can be induced to clear out the particle that your brain thinks caused the tickle sensation.
Is your question why we don't sneeze during sleep, or whether we wake up to sneeze and don't remember it? If your question is the former, while part of the reason is due to the lack of airflow and movement while you're asleep, there's also the idea that during sleep, the brain does not receive (as many) signals from the motor neurons responsible for reflexes such as sneezing due to 'REM atonia'. You would need much greater stimulation than a little tickle to be woken up from that state. Here's a nice summary of both of these concepts:  URL_0 
Many of the legacy US airlines are/where encumbered by self-funded pension programs that have a lot of retired former employees. More older employees who have earned raises, and therefore cost the airline more in payroll. Maybe the employees have better benefits. Legacy US airlines may also own older aircraft which are not as fuel efficient, or have higher maintenance costs. Foreign airlines, might have (younger) employees with lower pay and less benefits than their US counterparts. They may own newer aircraft which may be more fuel efficient or have lower maintenance costs. Maybe even lower taxes or subsidies from the nation.
Chains only last longer than belts when they are inside an enclosure where they can be kept clean and lubricated. In an exposed application a belt will usually last longer and needs less maintenance. In all of the products mentioned a chain could be used, but would significantly increase the manufacturing costs. Belts work well enough.

The mechanism of action isn't well understood, but as someone who's done literally a couple hundred hits of LSD lifetime, on high dose experiences you begin to forget who you are and lose a sense of individuality and feel like you're just melting into the universe. There is no longer a "you", there is only everything. We are all a part of the universe, just groups of atoms and molecules spit out randomly and perfectly in just a way that we are able to identify ourselves and observe our universe. At lower doses there isn't this "ego death" as much as you realize that anger is a choice and we are just another animal existing in a spec of dust in a universe grander than we could ever imagine

Pain and excitement receptors are closely linked. When dogs are excited they're less likely to feel the pain as pain. Same reason you don't feel as much pain during sex.
While some Christians prefer the King James translation of the Bible, there are many, many translations of the Bible in many different languages, made at different times. Christianity is a world religion, and has become very aggressive about translating its holy texts into whatever languages its people speak. The original languages of the Bible are Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. What we call "Modern English" didn't exist until shortly before the time of Shakespeare - and the King James Bible. There are earlier English translations, but they're even more difficult to read for people nowadays. The influence  &  staying power of the King James Version comes from a couple of things: the translation was made after the invention of the printing press, so it was widely available. The translation was authorized by the Church of England, which used it exclusively, so anywhere that the C of E had influence, the KJV did too: it wasn't too long after the KJV was published that the British Empire circled the globe, bringing British culture and religion with it. And the KJV was, for its time, the best English translation available. There are other translations of the Bible made about that time and later, but for centuries the KJV remained dominant for the reasons above. But languages change over time, and the meanings of words change. Eventually re-translation is necessary. The last century has produced a number of very good English translations now widely used by English-speaking Christians. (My favorite is the English Standard Version, first published in 2001.) But because the KJV was the dominant translation for so long, its language has become entrenched in English-speaking society. And people like tradition. It feels weird to change how a holy text reads or sounds. People stick with what they know or what they're used to. Therefore the KJV is still around and will still be around for many years.
So, going way back (edit: more than 10,000 years prior to the War of the Rings), Iluvatar was the original creator of life on the world of Lord of the Rings (Arda), and of his creations, which included the Valar (beings of great power who basically run things from afar) and the Maiar (beings of slightly lesser power, including the istari (wizards) like Gandalf and Sauron), and the elves, the elves were Iluvatar's favorites. So, one of the Valar, a bad guy named Morgoth, captured some elves and tried to use them to create his own "children" - but they were a perversion of the elves, lesser in every way. These "children" are the orcs that continue to live on well after Morgoth's departure from the world. Sauron and Saruman continue to use them as armies. These orcs live in the darkest places of earth, like Moria, and some of them couldn't stand being out in daylight (though Saruman bred some that could handle it). The reason they lose all the time is because (1) they initially didn't do too well in the sun, (2) they're not as smart as elves because they're a cheap copy, (3) they don't have love or any other driving force to help motivate them to really TRY to win, and finally, because it is suggested in Tolkien's works that when it counts, *when it really counts*, the Valar and Maiar kind of step in and help out a little bit. Gandalf, for example, lends great power and wisdom to the armies of elves and men throughout the War of the Rings, and some of the goodness and power of the valar still run through the earth and water of Arda. It's some supernatural shit. (Edit: for example, this is partially why the ringwraiths (black riders) are so hesitant to chase after Frodo when Arwen/Glorfindel carries him across the Bruinen, they don't want to go into the water, because the spirit of the Vala, Ulmo, still resides in some of the waters of Middle Earth). Anyway, it's been over 10 years since I was a real Tolkien scholar, but that sums it up pretty much in ELI5 terms, as far as I remember. Someone else might be able to provide a more accurate or detailed answer. Sources: The Silmarillion, the Unfinished Tales, Letters of Tolkien, LotR appendices. Edit: Someone else pointed out that they aren't as well trained, and this is probably part of it for sure. The men of Gondor and many different races of elves were well trained as warriors (especially because elves, who are immortal, had lived through previous dark periods prior to the War of the Rings), so they would have the tactical advantage in some ways. Edit: details and examples Edit: This is literally the only time I've ever felt I could contribute a useful answer in ELI5. Thanks OP.
Try to think about all the ways you could break into your home if you were a burglar. You get a bit of an advantage because you live there and know the layout. Now, ask 1 million burglars how they would break into your home. I guarantee they will find at least one way that you don't. All the internal testing in the world will never be as comprehensive as a huge number of people in your system finding things accidentally (or not accidentally).
I could be mistaken, but my perception is that the founder of Uber is a bit of a loudmouth jerk who gets himself in the papers for all the wrong reasons, while the founder of Lyft keeps his mouth shut.
Also known as "dropping the clutch", it means releasing the clutch very quickly, sometimes by slipping your foot off the pedal or fingers off the lever letting it "pop" to its resting position. One reason would be, with high revs, to break traction and engage in a "fuckin sick burnout". Another reason would be when trying to roll start a vehicle, where quickly disengaging the clutch is needed to transfer energy from the wheels back into the engine forcing the engine to turn over.
There are only two ways to measure something you're introducing into a recipe. Mass or volume. There was a time before it only cost $10 for a digital scale to keep in your kitchen. In that time, most recipes were made using volume measurements. In addition, the butter churning process ends with setting your butter in a container to solidify again. If you have your 1-cup measures that you pour it into to let solidify, then you already have 1 cup of butter measured. In more modern times, sticks of butter are a known size. A pound of butter is 2 cups, and a stick of butter is half a cup. These can be portioned off as needed for smaller measures.
Your appearance is defined by multiple genes and multiple pathways. For example you can share a similar face through inheriting different set of genes. So "external" similarity doesn't necessarily imply shared ancestry. Height for example is a multifactorial trait which depends among other things on nutrition, it's hard to say you **aren't** related to someone because he/she hasn't the same height. Other backdraw, since you inherit half of your genetic material from one of your parents it's hard to trace certain traits like "oh he has that kind of nose or hair* we have something in common" (without having the pedigree of both subjects you are comparing). Maybe he inherited those traits from a russian father while you got them thanks to your irish mother instead of your russian father. Also, -broadly speaking- the same genes are present in most of the populations or ethnicities, the diversity is derived from the frequency of said alleles (or variants within the genes) within the populations. In such way the sampling ~~bias~~ might affect your conclusions (If by chance you are in front of one of the few redhead from population X that hasn't anything to do with a shared origin with that subject). **Edit #2** There is no huge amount of genes that determine the physical appearance. And said gene/traits are the blank of strong sexual selection (let's say you prefer wide hips now). You are going to try to find a mate with wide hips regardless her ancestry whether she is from irish, italian or spanish ancestry (yeah I picked an actual example that could occur in my city/country). Then in a matter of few generations said traits are diluted or detached of some signal of ancestry (yeah you can actually say those hips look like someone from South America but that is all the "geographical context" you can provide or infer). No matter how long you are going to trace the problem or lineages the example works, I could have picked African descendants, or from Colombia for that matter and only think at a different scale. Then certain traits say little about ancestry since they are strongly selected.
If you want to watch a 45 minute TV show with more detail than a short video, there is a great TV series called "Mighty Ships" that covers different kinds of ships every episode. One episode is about the ship Tyco Resolute, which lays internet cable on the bottom of the ocean and sets up the land connections as well. It's a really great show and the Tyco Resolute episode is particularly interesting. [Mighty Ships, Tyco Resolute -- laying underwater internet cable]( URL_0 )

Muslim immigrants to Europe aren't really assimilating very well. This makes a lot of native Europeans scared; they think that Muslims are going to stage some sort of cultural takeover.
It's not gravitational forces that do this, it's collisions. Orbits at the same distance in anything *except* a single plane will collide. When that happens, the particles exchange momentum and tend to come out closer to an "everage" orbit, with a plane between the two incoming particles'. Repeat lots of times for millions of particles, and all of the particles end up in one plane. This also circularizes the orbits, for exactly the same reason: particles moving in will collide with particles moving out, and the radial motion will be averaged out.

The short answer is only the credit bureaus know exactly, but there's a few things that everyone knows play a role: *Length of credit history - longer is better *Payment history - no reported late payments, no reported defaults/delinquencies *Amount of available credit and ratio of used/unused credit - large amounts of available credit with a low usage ratio is best *Number of open lines - more are better, as long as they are paid on time

There isn't a lot of logic to how religions become popular. Mormonism was also pretty obviously made up relatively recently, but once these things pick up some momentum people get caught up in it. Once you're in a religion it's pretty difficult to acknowledge you might be wrong because you're so invested in it. In the case of scientology you may well have literally invested your whole life in it.
Iraq has a severe religious and ethnic divide. The democracy that was established had no systems in place to prevent that from becoming a problem, so the majority party filled the government with people of the same ethnicity and religion (Shia) as the leader. Those of other ethnicities and religions (particularly Sunni) felt that they had zero representation in government, and rebelled. A democratic Iraq would require a pretty complex constitution that enshrines representation for minority sects and ethnicities, but that was never put into place.
 >  > How would Puerto Rico becoming a US State work? Puerto Rico would have a referendum and decide if they want to be a state. Congress would vote if they want to start the statehood process for Puerto Rico Congress and Puerto Rico's territorial congress would work together to create a state constitution. Once that constitution is agreeable to both Congress and Puerto Rico a final vote in Congress happens to admit Puerto Rico as a state. The President signs that bill and The US has 51 states  >  >  Would the powers that be of USA want this to happen? The biggest hurdle the powers that be would have is adding Puerto Rice adds 2 senators and 4 or 5 congressmen, along with the 6 or 7 electoral votes that go along with those. This would concern one party if the other was more heavily represented in PR also this would diminish the voting power of smaller states especially the 3 vote states. Puerto Rico would also probably be a net taker of federal taxes but that depends on a lot of things.  >  > What would the impact be to the country as a whole to gain a new state? Day to day nothing really changes, Puerto Rico is basically a state now. There is free travel to and from the territory and free work access. it would really only effect election time. Taxes would increase for Puerto Ricans as they don't pay Federal Income Tax, but their tax burden may shift around to even that out, it depends on the exact way they are admitted as a state.
The word liberal originally meant something like "people should have liberty." That meant stuff like elected government, rule of law, that kind of stuff. No one is really against that anymore so anyone can call them selves "liberals" by this old meaning. In the 20th century, one group of liberals became important in the US and a different one in Europe. They both came out of the old meaning of liberal so they both called themselves liberal. In the US the thinking was something like, "To give people more liberty the government needs to help them out when they are down." In Europe it was something like, "To give people more liberty the government needs to get out of the way." Both are still about liberty but how to get it was very different. An important note: Conservative's aren't against liberty. Of course not, By the old definition, conservatives are also liberals. The opposite of a conservative isn't a liberal by that meaning, it's a progressive.
The idea was to prevent a nuclear war by making it unwinnable. To do that you have to impress on the other guys that no matter how clever they are or how lucky they get you'll always have enough nukes left to burn them to the ground and then scatter the ashes across the wasteland. Because if they think they have even a tiny chance of winning a nuclear exchange, they might start one. Mutually Assured Destruction was the name of the game. Nobody wins. Everybody dies.
I don't think it's necessarily that we crave sweets after a meal, so much as most people enjoy sweets, period. But since we need nutrients to be healthy, it's better to eat the stuff that's good for you first, before indulging. That way you've at least eaten the "real" food, and won't fill up just on sweets. At home, this is just part of being responsible for your own well-being. When you're at a restaurant, they understand that people enjoy sweets and may still order them even if they're full, so they're eager to offer dessert to make more money. Addendum, just for clarity: we enjoy sugar so much because it's more scarce in the wild, so we've evolved to hunt it out. We obviously haven't evolved out of that part yet, since now most people get too much of it.
for me I think it's the fact that dozing off on your couch whilst watching a TV show or reading a book is super nice, but also natural and sorta involuntary... whereas when you're in bed, you're so conscious of 'having to sleep now' that the awareness itself prevents you from going to sleep...
Not my answer but an answer I found on a forum from 2004.  > In a 640nm red laser pointer, there's a red-emitting diode and a lens to collimate (focus) the beam.  > In a 532nm green laser (pointer or larger size), there's a BIG infrared laser diode that generates laser light at 808nm, this is fired into a crystal containing the rare-earth element "neodymium". This crystal takes the 808nm infrared light and lases at 1064nm (yes, deeper in the infrared!). This 1064nm laser light comes out of the NdYV04 (neodymium yttrium vanadium oxide) crystal and is then shot into a second crystal (containing potassium, titanium,  & amp; phosphorus, usually called KTP) that doubles the frequency to 532nm - the bright green color you see. This light is then collimated (focused) by a lens and emerges out the laser's "business end". Just before the lens, there's a filter that removes any stray IR (infrared) rays from the pump diode and the neodymium crystal. Basically, with green diode laser pointers there are lots of itty bitty parts, and they all need to be aligned by hand. If the polarisation is "off", one or both crystals need to be turned. The overall process of making and the parts make the green one more expensive. With red diode lasers, you just slap in the diode and slap a lens in front of it, which makes it cheaper. You can also see an image [here]( URL_0 ) which more or less shows how the green laser pointer is more complex.
Quarterbacks at the college level deal with a whole different type of defense and game then the NFL. That's why a lot of those quarterbacks who can scramble for big games in college turn out to be a bust. Players in the NFL are too quick and the defenses are too much for a scrambling quarterback to do very well, especially right after college.
1. In extremely violent tornado storms that wipe out entire cities, virtually no structure, regardless of material, can survive the wind and still be within reasonable cost. Instead most houses in tornado-prone areas have much safer and cheaper underground shelters. ([Here's a bank vault where 23 people took shelter that withstood an EF5 tornado]( URL_0 ). As you can see it protected the occupants but nevertheless sustained considerable damage. Most people can't afford to or really want to live in a windowless bank vault.) 2. In less violent tornado storms the tornado will only travel through a very narrow path, so the chance of getting hit by a tornado is very low and it's simply not cost effective to tear down every house and replace it with brick houses. Most new subdivisions in these areas are stronger and can withstand a mild tornado. 3. Flying debris is a major cause of death and injuries. Wood will break apart into smaller and lighter pieces while brick and concrete will not break apart easily, they will make much more dangerous hazard.
The likely reason is compatibility. Many more devices and programs play MP3 than FLAC. For example, the Ipod, arguably the most popular portable audio player, doesn't play FLAC(or at least, didn't the last I knew). If Amazon sold audio files in FLAC, they'd either have to: 1. Also offer the MP3, thus doubling the size of their stock 2. Offer support for converting to MP3, thus increasing their tech support needs, and losing themselves customers. 3. Refuse to support non-FLAC uses, which means they'd not be compatible with Ipods and other non-FLAC players. In short, it makes a lot more sense for them to offer the most popular format in their store.
There are a lot of people saying "They don't". That is wrong. They do. In the healing process, a hormone known as VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is released, and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. The details are complicated, but oftentimes instead of one vessel connecting itself on both sides, you have several to many smaller vessels forming from both sides, joining up with each other, and ultimately connecting the two sides. Imagine a big pipe that gets split into smaller pipes that all eventually connect back to the big pipe on the other side. That's the simple version. The complicated version involves scar tissue, collagen production and breakdown, a host of hormones and humoral factors, but the bottom line is that vessels do, in fact, re-grow. Without the ability to grow new vessels, healing would not be possible. They are necessary to transport the oxygen and nutrients required for re-growth and healing.
In my Native tradition I call this the blue wolf. It came out of seeking a private vision for my life from the Creator when I was lost and going through one my lowest times. It was inspired by the medicine wheel teachings of my tribe and from the wisdom of my kind Elders. It saved my life, but I am not a therapist, I respectfully do not speak for other Natives, or even other members of my tribe. This was my personal vision that guided me to change the entire path of my life forever. Take what you like and leave the rest. Find out for yourself. If you choose that path, you have to follow the blue wolf into the forest and see where it leads. If you try to control it your are not following. If you try to jump ahead and lead it you are not following. Follow the blue wolf and see where it leads and more will be revealed. Your blue wolf may even lead your to your own private vision for your life. Aho!
Its typically red wine that gets better with age, white wine turns to vinegar. Its down to personal preference also.
Cancer is caused by a mutation in cell replication. Our cells go through checkpoints to make sure everything is replicating right. If something is wrong, the process is usually shut down. If it makes it past this point without being shut down, the immune cells typically will destroy the mutated cells before they can spread. Your body basically is constantly making and killing cancer cells. The problem occurs when these cells get past these protective mechanisms and are able to duplicate.
The aim of a silencer is to break up/soften the noise of the weapon firing. It does this by directing the air leaving the muzzle through a series of baffles, slowing and redirecting the air so that it will form a 'softer' noise, rather than a single loud pulse. The noise you hear in the movies is not representative of the average silenced weapon, but is a plot device to let bad (or good) guys do their job steathily. In practice, the silencer will reduce the noise and make it harder to pinpoint, but will not give anything like as significant a reduction in volume
No advantage to the imperial. The changes are arithmetic only. The metric system being standardised in orders of magnitude makes it significantly easier to remember. It's worth pointing out they are (were?) both standardised. The difference is one is standardised in a much more user friendly way. Look at these two Imperial units list [this] ( URL_1 ) and [this] ( URL_2 ). These are *slightly* different from the ones the US uses, but comparable enough for this (it's a bit like the difference between US English and correct English :P ) Now look at [this]( URL_0 ) This one is much easier to remember.
Also, cisgender only refers to gender and has nothing to do with sexual orientation. Gay and bisexual men and women can also be cisgender, just as transgender men and women can be straight.
Economy of scale. Mass retailers have a lower cost for goods so they are able to undercut smaller stores to take away their business. They could even operate a single store at a loss in order to force their competition out of business while absorbing the loss across the chain. Add to that the American consumers desire for conformity and familiar surroundings and you have the perfect recipe.
Try to imagine the solar system before there was even really a star. There would have been a cloud of material flying all around. If everything was very random, then very little would have enough speed to avoid being sucked into the newly forming star. If some things had a velocity in one direction and other things had a velocity in another direction, then they would likely end up dragging on each other, slow down, and get pulled in. What we think happened is that as the sun was forming, it acquired a spin and that spin ended up transferring to the cloud of material, shaping it into a disc which eventually would collect together to form the planets. Without this spin, the material would have just fallen into the sun and it would have burned a little bit brighter.
This is a hugely debated question in the philosophy of mind. I think it's fair to say that the answer is far from clear. It may be the case that intentional states cannot be realized in physical systems. Trying to give a physicalist account of intentional states is an active research program in the philosophy of mind. Try looking up "qualia".
Police unions. No one has mentioned this yet. As most police officers are unionized, any change to their working conditions has to be approved through collective bargaining (negotiating with the union). Union contracts often run for 3-5 years so the state can't just tell cops to start using them. Since many police union members (cops) don't want the cameras the unions can delay or prevent departments from adopting them. Police unions are often politically powerful and politicians generally don't like to ram things down their throats that they really don't want. This is why in many places they've either been slow to adopt cameras or haven't done it at all. Note: I'm not demonizing police unions. They are not the sole reason that cameras are not fully adopted. Money is probably the number one reason, but there are also privacy concerns as well.
This question comes up about various websites fairly often, and I'm afraid it makes no sense. Websites are not required to change because of your perception of what a website needs to look like "right now". That website does its job, it fulfils its functionality and it's not in any danger from competition. Why would someone put in the immense amount of effort to change it? What do you think it's missing? Edit: Apostrophes. Edit-Edit: I has too many apostrophes in my original comment. Craigslist is not missing apostrophes to my knowledge.
"Not Guilty" means there is no sufficient proof against you. "Innocent" means you did not do it.
Mars has a surface rather similar to Earth’s. Granted, there is no comparable atmosphere, but as a landing site for rovers and such it is perfect. Venus is gaseous and stormy. And HOT!
There are multiple reasons but one of the biggest is the cost to make and receive calls. From Wikipedia:  >   >   > The cost of making voice calls from a satellite phone varies from around $0.15 to $2 per minute, while calling them from landlines and regular mobile phones is more expensive. Costs for data transmissions (particularly broadband data) can be much higher. Rates from landlines and mobile phones range from $3 to $14 per minute with Iridium, Thuraya[22] and Inmarsat being some of the most expensive networks to call. The receiver of the call pays nothing, unless they are being called via a special reverse-charge service.  >   >   > Making calls between different satellite phone networks is often similarly expensive, with calling rates of up to $15 per minute.  >   >   > Calls from satellite phones to landlines are usually around $0.80 to $1.50 per minute unless special offers are used. Such promotions are usually bound to a particular geographic area where traffic is low.  >   >   > Most satellite phone networks have pre-paid plans, with vouchers ranging from $100 to $5,000. Most people are not going to pay that much for themselves much less buy satellite phones for their kids.
It's typically based on the year it ends production, not starts. For instance many 2015 models start production in mid/late 2014 and stop production in early/mid 2015. There's a lot of exceptions to this and it's largely marketing driven more than anything.
There's a very fine thin layer of salty water over your eyes, which protects your eyes and cleans them from dust and other small particles. When this protective layer gets in contact with another fluid, it will flow together. This is just what fluids do (*#justfluidthings*). The thin layer is now distorted and your eye cant make up for the light distortion, causing your vision to go blurry. Wearing goggles prevent the water from touching your eye. This also happens when you cry, even with goggles on. Source: Not a doctor, but I know chemistry and stuff
Possibly abstraction. At 50', you see a likely fatal fall. At 40,000' you see an abstract landscape which is pretty. At some point your mind may turn "oh shit, I'm going to fall and die because I'm high up" into "that's interesting."
Ethics are the comprehension and understanding of morals. It's like the difference between anthropology and actually being a human. One is study, the other is application. To quote a famous example: The ethical man knows that it is wrong to cheat on his spouse, the moral man doesn't cheat on his spouse.
 >  Why is everyone that pleads "not guilty" in a court case, but later found guilty, not also given a perjury charge (along with their initial charges)? A plea is not sworn testimony from the defendant, it is just the demand of "prove it" to the prosecution. Also it would act to derail the intended operation of the legal process; if you are going to be charged with perjury if you lose then why not lie your ass off at every opportunity? If you win you get off and if you lose you are going to be convicted of perjury for defending yourself anyway. And that is what it really comes down to: You have a *right to a legal defense*. To charge you with perjury just for pleading not guilty would violate your fundamental right to legal defense and would be a violation of human rights. You gotta' watch out for those.
We can feel frequencies below our audible range. Some film producers/directors use "infrasound", as in, sound that has a frequency of below 20hz to introduce suspension or fear in the audience to enhance a scene. When you are walking on a suspension bridge and it sways, you can feel that, its still vibration, just not audible. If the bridge vibrated hard enough and fast enough, you would hear it as it would push and pull the air fast enough to make it audible. In terms of headphones, the effect of infrasound and sounds above 20khz are negligable. That's because the drivers \(speakers\) in your headphones are more than likely too small a diameter to accurately produce those frequencies to a sound pressure level \(db\) that you would be able to "feel".
[Here's the Cleveland Clinic's guide to pee]( URL_0 ). Lots of colorful information in there.
Fire isn't really a thing that creates light and heat, it is the light and heat that results from a process. When something is burning, it's a chain reaction of combustion, which is basically a fuel (the material that's burning) combining with oxygen in a chemical process that creates a bunch of heat. This process and all of the heat released by it creates a pocket of gas that's so hot that it glows and emits light. And that glowing gas is the flame that we see .
The mucus comes directly from the surface of your nose, called a mucous membrane because it produces mucus to protect itself and as lubrication. This mucus is a combination of long, stringy proteins and water, which allows it to stick to most surfaces. We produce a ton of it while we have upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold because our immune systems are trying to isolate the virus causing the infection and prevent more from getting in. This measure isn't actually that effective, as it only slows down viruses and bacteria can swim right through it, but we do it anyway. Allergies do the same thing because they are an attempt by the immune system to attack something that isn't actually a disease, like pollen. We are less clear on why allergies happen, but some hypothesize that they occur due to infants and children living in environments that are far too clean. Their immune systems don't have anything to fight, so they start fighting random things instead.
Because your nerve endings, which are also being mercilessly subject to your sterilization routine, don't understand the nuance of wound treatment.
This has to do with a confirmation bias. Think of it this way. Everyone thinks that toupees are terrible and extremely easy to spot. This is a problem because the only toupees that you spot are the bad ones. The good ones or 'passable' ones go on unnoticed. The same is for gay men. You tend to notice the gay men who fit the stereotype: effeminate voices, metrosexual dress, vaguely flamboyant, yet all of the gays that do not posses these traits often go unnoticed. Or even then you tend to overlook their existence somewhat because the human brain tends to mentally overlook something that doesn't agree with their preconceived notions.
Because the product they are selling is the ink. The sell the printers at reduced price to get them in as many homes as possible so they can sell you the expensive ink. It is the same basic principle as video game consoles. They take a loss on the consoles and make the money on the games
Flowering plants did not exist prior to insects. Before animals evolved plants either self pollinated or pollinated via the wind.
Radio uses less bandwidth. Streaming cost are lower. Most tv stations get money from cable and satellite companies. They dont want to jepordize that money by using live streaming. OTA companies have already partnered with hulu and other companies.
A line has 1 dimension because if you're on the line, a single number is enough to describe exactly where you are. A point has 0 dimensions because if you're on the point, you need no numbers to describe exactly where you are.
Having a high dynamic range (the difference in volume at reference amplification between the lowest whisper sound and the loudest explosion in the soundtrack) is often a sought after factor. In proper professional movie theatres where you won't bother a neighbour this is a good thing. For most consumers it's pretty annoying. If you're able to, when I set up my surround sound I program the center channel at least 3db louder than any other speaker to compensate for the quiet voice thing. Many receiver/amps have also a night mode that compresses Dynamic range as well although I haven't been a fan when I've tried it.
I dont know who you've been talking to, but it's generally agreed that he was no genius. He did have a rather good staff though. The main downfall of the nazi regime was the same as it's success, their speed and aggression. They pushed too far and too fast, making too many enemies. It wasnt a sustainable model, and neither was the regime itself. He was an excellent orator though, that was what he did best. In the end he did convince an awful lot of people to go an awful long way out of their normal behaviour.
Say Bob has a bunch of stock in a business called Company, Inc. Bob's friend Henry thinks Company, Inc.'s stock is about to drop significantly. Henry makes a deal with Bob: Bob will lend Henry 100 shares of Company, Inc. stock, but Henry has to give it all back exactly one year from now. So Henry gets 100 shares and sells them at their current price of $10 each. Henry now has $1000, but he'll have to buy back 100 shares before the end of the year in order to hold up his end of the bargain. A year later, Company, Inc. stock isn't doing so well, selling for only $1 a share. Henry buys up 100 shares and gives them back to Bob. By shorting the Company, Inc. stock, Henry made a profit of $900. In an alternate universe, Company, Inc. is doing pretty good at the end of the year. Their stock is selling for $20 a share. In order to get the 100 shares he needs to give back to Bob, Henry has to use the $1000 he got from selling the stock originally AND $1000 from his own pocket. In this universe, Henry's attempt to short the Company, Inc. stock has cost him $1000.
When some female animals are in heat, they undertake actions known as presenting, signaling readiness for intercourse, which in some species triggers hormonal cascades in males, basically turning them into horny fuckbunnies. Human females are fecund year round, and human males get turned on by all manner of displays, some instinctual, some conditioned. There are all kinds of maladaptive behaviors men undertake when they posit that a female in their vicinity is signaling sexual readiness. Some joke that men can think with only one head at a time. And fathers of many human females will be damned if they let her get nude before that high school dropout junkie who likes to sweet talk her. In most modern societies, being nude before a male of the species typically IS a signal of readiness for intercourse and vice versa.
1) Anti-masturbation mentality in religious and secular (scientific) groups in the late 1800s. Spearheaded by many, including Kellogg. 2) Medical reports from WWI stating that it was healthier. It was, in the horrid conditions of the trenches where people could not clean properly. It is not much of a difference in people who maintain hygiene. 3) People trusting their doctors to know better than them what should be done with infants.
Bicycle races have few corners and so air resistance is the biggest factor. This is similar to for example NASCAR and speed skating. And the best way to combat air resistance is to sit right behind another racer. And when everyone does this then you get a big massive pack. Another problem in bicycle racing is that there are very few pitstops. There is usually one or two places along a course where a rider might get a bag of snacks but this is not enough to sustain him throughout the race. So the racers are followed by cars bringing water to them. But to get to the cars the cyclists have to drop out of the pack and then race them again with all the extra water. So most of the members of a team is not supposed to win anything. They are just paid to bring water to the pack, control the speed of the pack when needed and to help fighting for position within the pack. If you have watched a sprint you may notice that there is a lot of people starting early and then giving up far from the line. These are not supposed to win but supposed to help their team mates get a better start to the sprint. As for the team tactics there is a lot of things going on. Tour de France have a lot of different objectives that teams can go for so the team manager have a lot of different options during the race. Every team also have a captain to help make decisions. There is also a lot of unwritten rules among the riders that help create a friendly environment for them all. So you very often see riders help each other during the race even if they do not directly benefit from this. Bad manners will make the three weeks very hard for you and may even prevent the team from getting invited for next year.
Vitamins aren't like magic substances that boost your body's stats. Most are enzyme co-factors, which means that they are required for the enzyme to work. It's sort of like keys to a car: if you have a shortage, that is a real problem since the car won't work. Having 500 car keys doesn't make the car work any better than having 1 car key though.
It's all to do with the speed of the water as it passes over the lip. If the water is moving slowly then it will not overcome the force holding it to the glass (adhesion). However if it moves quickly, the water has more momentum and it can break free and pour away from the glass. If the water cannot "break free" of the surface then it will simply roll over the lip of the glass and trickle down the outside. The spout on a jug, you'll notice, curves downward slightly when the jug is held at a pouring angle. Obviously the more vertical the water stream the faster it flows, so jugs pour nice clean streams if water.
Corporations are not people, as much as some politicians and pundits would like you to believe, however, in order to do business, they have to be granted some of the same rights as people. People and pets have the right to not be physically abused, but that doesn't make pets people. As a REPRESENTATIVE of a group of people, a corporation needs the ability to do things like enter into contracts, be taxed and act as a single entity for a group of people. Corporations also shield individuals from the liabilities of a company. If a company goes bankrupt, the debtors can't take money away from the individual shareholders. Basically, a corporation is a legal construct to allow a group of people (shareholders) do business.
The maps weren't all that accurate, but they were made by using a ship to follow coastlines, plotting the direction and length of time taken to reach a certain point, all while staying the same distance from the shore. This allowed for maps that, while lacking in detail, showed enough of the area to be useful for navigation.
Here's a way to mentally visualize it. Imagine a bunch of treadmills lined up side by side, each going at different speeds. You're on one treadmill running, and you want to move over to the next treadmill, but in order to move over, you have to make sure your legs are running at the speed of the new treadmill, otherwise you'll fall off. You can try and run directly onto the next treadmills, but you probably won't be able to change your running speed fast enough, and you'll fall down (Grind gears). Or you can step off the current treadmill (disengage the clutch), grab the rails of the new treadmill and hold yourself over the rotating belt until you're confident that your legs are running at the correct speed (modulate the clutch) , and let go of the rails (engage the clutch) and continue running.
There's plenty being exported from Africa. This has to do with a few factors. 1) Africa is geopolitically unstable: we invented most of the countries that exist there after WWI. As a result, they aren't like the homogeneous countries in Europe, which have their millennium long histories. These are places where there are hundreds of different tribes, with different identities. In Europe, we more or less eliminated the tribal system some time during the first millenium. 2) We fucked up Africa pretty hard with colonialism. I'm not entirely sure how relevant this point is now, but we didn't exactly do a great job of setting up infrastructure there. 3) The environment is fairly shitty: In NA, we used chemical warfare to eliminate disease bearing mosquitos. We never seemed to take this play to Africa, which might be for the best, given the ecological damage we did.
Yes and no. It depends really how you account for money. If you look at monetary base (for simplicity, just all the cash in an economy), then the bank did not increase the amount of money. If you look at M1 money supply (which is monetary base plus checking accounts) or M2 money supply (which is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposit accounts), then yes the bank created "money". This in economics is known as the money multiplier. It won't be twice as much because the bank has to hold onto a specific amount depending on the central bank. In the US, most large banks have to hold onto 10% of all deposits before loaning it out or investing it. So if we look at a simple money multiplier, the bank would only create 90% more money after a single transaction.
You're not using the word "tactically" properly. Tactics is the hour by hour planning of a single fight. Wars are only lost tactically if there is a huge pitched battle that crushes an army or navy, like the Battle of Midway or Waterloo. *Strategy* is the overall planning of a war, from supplies, weapons used, units brought into the theater, tactics they employ, and final objective. The US did not have a strategy for victory in Vietnam. In conventional war, capturing the enemy capital city is often the objective; the US never invaded North Vietnam at all, as this would have caused China and the USSR to become involved. Instead, they tried to fight communists in South Vietnam and hope they would get tired of fighting and quit. In fact, after the Tet offensive, the North Vietnamese were just about ready to stop active military campaigns in the south, but the threat wouldn't have ended at all.
Kinda, yes. We have a [circadian clock]( URL_0 ), a biological mechanism that works by releasing certain hormones over a 24 hour period, as well as taking external cues such as the Sun. Without external cues, the circadian clock can actually run a bit longer or shorter than 24 hours, and in babies it's still all messed up (which is why they have an irregular sleep schedule). Not just humans have a circadian clock, almost every animal does. This has nothing to do with leap years though, since leap years just add a whole day, not messing with our circadian clock.
They can sell a small portion of their stock. Or they can get a loan against the value of the stock, which can be sold in the future.
The core itself is like a hot rock, more or less. It's continually having coolant of some sort passed by it to keep it from getting too hot. This heats up that coolant quite a bit. That coolant, in turn, passes it's heat on to water sitting in a boiler, heating it up to several hundred degrees, creating steam. That steam is then used to spin massive turbine generators, which output electrical power. There's a lot in there about choice of coolant and how heat is transferred across materials, but essentially: hot rock makes hot liquid, makes hot water/steam, spins turbine.
There are two main ways. The most important is repetition. Scientists often repeat each others' experiments, and tend not to accept anything unless it's been shown to be repeatable. The other is peer reviews, where other scientists review each paper before it gets published. This might not catch the specific issue of deliberately falsifying data, but it does guard against people publishing things with serious errors or misunderstandings in them.
For most people soccer is the cheapest sport to put your kid in as well. Until they move up in skill they need minimal equipment to play.
This has always bothered me. How come some guy blaring his car stereo at 90 decibels deserves a ticket, but some guys motorcycle blasting down my street at 180 decibels so loud it's rattling my windows and scaring small children is socially acceptable?
By that logic there are many tiers of football. NCAA football isn't "pro" but it's pretty much the minor leagues. There's also arena football, and tons of other leagues that would be the equivalent of the bottom tiers of English soccer.
There's actually a psychological principle called "habituation," where you get used to something and the novelty wears off. Whatever income level you have becomes normal, and you want to break beyond it. Regardless of actual income, the average human being thinks they'll be happier earning "10-15% more" than whatever you currently make. But happiness is better understood as a personality trait, not something that comes from a reaction to the quality of your life. So this means that most people feel like they're chasing their happiness/contentedness, but really they're just slightly unhappy people. Think of it like a drug addiction. You're middle class, but want to be upperclass. You feel unhappy because you can only afford to rent an apartment, you have a crappy car, you vacation to New Jersey, etc. Then you make a million dollars, and all of a sudden you can afford a nice house, a nice car, take more exotic vacations, etc. Then that begins to feel like the baseline "norm." You want something additional to make you happier. You want more money to get that vacation home, three cars, be able to take vacations 3 months out of the year. That drive to move forward and have a little more never ends. And the more you get, the higher your tolerance is. It takes more and more to get that same "happy" rush you got from being able to afford your first house. All of a sudden you want original picasos, exotic animals, you want a penthouse suite in Dubai. And so on.
Sometimes it gets trapped and builds up pressure. The pressure is what causes pain. It gets trapped because there is other stuff in the way.

You will not, it's part inherited, part developed through childhood trauma. You will not likely recognize it in a person, because a sociopath has learned to emulate all emotions like a regular one. However since they are unable to feel empathy or love you could approach them with those subjects.
A reliable food source, basically. Sometimes you can 'poach' cats by putting out a reliable food source. Had this happen to one of our cats once.
TL;DR It's not. Ebola is contracted in poor African villages when people have to resort to eating dead animals (fruit-bats mainly) they've found in the rain forest. It then spreads through contact with an infected person's bodily fluids (blood, sperm, etc). These people can't afford the necessary healthcare and it tends to just wipe out a lot of people quite quickly (up to 90% fatality rate in central Africa according to WHO). I think people fear it as the symptoms are quite violent, with extreme vomiting and diarrhea being the main case. The thing is, it's quite treatable in first world countries, and isn't really any more dangerous than a lot of diseases you could contract eating infected raw meat. The media has just blown it out of proportion like it always does with 'super' diseases.
Usually, conspiracy theories **are** investigated, in some way. Quite thoroughly, in any instance where there could be truth to the allegations. But then the people who believe in them won't take "that insane thing you said didn't happen" for an answer. Instead, they decide that whoever did the investigating is part of the conspiracy. Obviously, some things do not require investigation. Like the conspiracy theory which states that the Queen of England is a reptilian space alien. We can dismiss that one out of hand. EDIT: A perfect example of a conspiracy theory that's been totally investigated to death: the idea that the moon landing was faked. Ludicrous amounts of evidence has been amassed, proving that it wasn't faked. The footage has been examined to a ridiculous level of detail. The fact of the matter is, it was not possible to fake the landing, using 1969 technology. But people refuse to accept that, and go on believing what they want...in part because it makes them feel good to be "in the know," or "not a sheep like everyone else." That's the main psychology, in my opinion. Conspiracy theorists are usually massive egotists. They can't stand the idea that they might not be smarter than everyone else, and they **certainly** cannot entertain the possibility that they might be incorrect.
You can tell by the way someone is betting. When the situation is favorable based on the count, that's when you want to start betting heavy. Also, card counters often work in groups and so if additional people start showing up at the table and everyone is betting heavy, it's a pretty good indicator that something's up.
Well, let me try to help. I'm not a psychologist, psychiatrist or health professional of aky kind, but I have experienced different levels of depression through the last few years, and maybe that qualifies me to provide you some input. The main issue when trying to explain depression is simply the fact that the word "depression" is widely missused to identify "sadness". People say "I'm depressed" when, in fact, what they are experiencing is a normal reaction to a bad situation, such as the loss of a loved one or the end of a relationship. Depression is NOT sadness. Far from it. Actually, if you are sad, and can pinpoint the cause of your sadness, you are not likely to be depressed. In my experience, the word that most accurately describes depression is "numbness". You know when you spend too much time lying on your arm, or too long sitting with your elbows against your knees, and you arm/leg "falls asleep"? That's depression, but instead of not feeling anything in your arms or legs, you don't feel any propper emotion. That's why sometimes people DO get depressed after a specially traumatic event, just like your limbs get numb after too much pressure on a certain point. The parts of you that are responsible for feeling certain things simply fail to do so. They "fall asleep". Depressed people are usually seen as "sad" by others for the simple fact that they are not feeling anything and, therefore, show no signs of stimulation. You tell them something that should be really heartbreaking and they reply with a simple "yeah, I know, that sucks", because for them no emotional response was triggered by the information you just provided. It's just like poking a numb limb with a toothpick, and assuming that it is dead because it didnt jerk or twitch or cause that person to say "ouch". It is not dead, its just not feeling that poke. That is tremendously hard to explain to other people for another very simple reason: your subjective experience of life cannot be shared with others. There is no way to do it, no way you can explain someone how the color red looks to you without resorting to some sort of comparisson ("red is the color of tomatoes and Super Mario's hat!"), which is a technique that doesnt really work since there is no way to tell if the other person sees tomatoes and Super Mario the same way that you do. Maybe the way I see the color of a tomato is, for you, what you would call green. There is no way to know. So when your spouse sees your actions and perceives them as a sign of you being sad, he is naturally going to assume that it should be easy to fix by simply doing something fun and chasing the sadness away. He is failing to realize that you cannot experience the sensation of "something fun", because the parts of you that are responsible for feeling that are "asleep". And when you tell him "this is not sadness, it is depression!", what he hears is "this is not sadness, it is sadness!", since the word is so widely missused. And then he does something that should make you feel better if you were just sad, but you don't, and he assumes that you simply refuse to feel better, because he can't experience what you are experiencing. Try and get your spouse to do some reading about depression, and ask him to give you some credit and believe that what you feel is different than what he feels. If he is a reasonable guy, he'll get it eventually. Finally, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Its a terrible thing, and it kind of feeds itself be keeping you away from the world. The more depressed you are, the less appealing the world seems to you and you end up doing less and less things, which gets you deeper and deeper into depression. But there is one thing your spouse is right about: you do have to do something about it. It feels wrong, it feels like nothing is going to help because you never feel anything anyway, but you need to look for help, maybe get a therapist, maybe get medicated. Think of it like getting up in the morning to go out for a jog - it feels terrible to do it, and once you do get to it you dont feel any thinner. But if you keep at it, keep doing it even though you are tired or sleepy or lazy, you WILL get thinner, you WILL feel less and less lazy, and it WILL be better for you. TL;DR: Depression is a numbness of the mind, and you cant explain that to people because nobody REALLY understands how another person feels, subjectivelly. Depression is not sadness, it is failure to properly perceive stimulation. (BTW, English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammar mistakes)
It depends on a lot of factors. For instance, some states will only pay *exonerated* prisoners. Note that being "exonerated" is different from being found "not guilty" on appeal or at a new trial. "Exonerated" is defined by some states as being absolutely ruled out as a guilty person-- for instance, by DNA evidence. It is not enough to be found "not guilty" on appeal because of, for instance, bad jury instructions. Other states only offer compensation for people who are convicted because of misconduct by prosecutors or police-- not just a bad jury decision that is later set aside. That can make getting compensation very hard in cases of coerced confessions (which *do* happen). In many states, there are legal guidelines for payouts to the wrongfully imprisoned, but the money isn't paid automatically. People who are wrongfully sent to prison often have to sue to get this money-- and the cost involved in suing can make it hard. The Innocence Project has a [good guide to which states in the United States have laws to pay the wrongfully imprisoned]( URL_0 ). For instance, Nevada doesn't have any laws to pay people wrongfully sent to prison. Texas, on the other hand, provides $80k per year in prison, plus $25k per year spent on the sex offender registry, college tuition, and back child support payments-- but only if the wrongfully imprisoned person has been pardoned or "granted relief on the basis of actual innocence". The short answer is: it varies significantly from place to place. And this is a fairly US-centric answer: I have no idea what the laws are outside the United States.
Normally they tell the other country they are launching a missile. [Though sometimes they forget and there's a bit of a nuclear scare]( URL_0 ). So far this hasn't torched off a nuclear war because most tests are just 1 rocket. And a full first strike would involve hundreds of rockets. Also the missile might not be headed in the direction of anything of value. If the choice was potentially starting a nuclear war on accident or losing an uninhabited island in the middle of the pacific that you technically own, most people pick the latter.
There are three states that the world can be in: *One superpower* *Multiple superpowers* *No super powers (every country equally as strong as another)* Lets start with the last one. By nature, countries will compete for dominance over one another for political, economic, and security reasons. Therefore this state is almost unattainable. Not all countries can afford or care to keep up with the others, so there will never be a time when no country is more powerful than others. Now for the middle state, *multiple superpowers*. This is what the cold war was. This ends up the same as we discussed above, because the countries that CAN afford to compete for power DO compete, and end up in 'cold' wars with one another. This can happen with any number of countries, for instance during the last half of the 20th century it was two (US and USSR), but it could easily happen with three, four, or more countries competing for dominance. First on this list is close to what we have now, *one superpower*. The united states 'won' the cold war because the other guy quit competing. That left it with no other country even CLOSE to being as powerful militarily or spending as much as they did. Here they had two options: stop spending because our main threat is 'gone', or keep spending to PREVENT them from being able to come back. The US chose the latter, obviously. Many people think that a system of one superpower is the most realistic 'best' option. It is unrealistic to think that countries will not compete with each other, and a cold war is dangerous for the entire planet because nuclear arms exist. The theory is this: If the US spends so much money and has such a large military presence in most of the world that they can counter any emerging threats before they get too big, that *theoretically* means that other countries would have a hard time becoming powerful enough to inflict major harm on other countries because the US *could* swoop in at any time and stop them. While the US is not a perfect country, most of the world (the west and some of Asia) thinks that the US is a good choice because *the other candidates are worse*. Russia? Most of the world doesn't want them to have the power. China? Same thing. Both have terrible human rights records and less obligation to do things fairly because they don't answer to their citizens in the same way. While the US doesn't do things fairly or always do the 'right' thing, it's pretty much the only candidate for the job that has a *chance* of doing the right thing. Ancillary reasons: With the US military being so large and powerful, many Europeans countries can spend WAY less money per capita on their military. This is good for them. Part of the reason the US spends more than the next 13 countries combined is because they hardly spend anything at all since they either can't keep up enough to matter against the US military or they are friends with the US. The US spends a lot but we have for all of recent memory so the citizens don't put up much fuss. It also helps that having the most powerful military in the world allows you to exert your will on other countries for political, economic, or security reasons.
Computer storage and the human memory are not directly comparable. Computers store information as states of "on" or 1s and "off" or 0s. A single one or zero is a bit, and 8 of these put together (at least in most modern computers) is a byte. But brains don't work like that at all. We store memories as connections between nerve cells, so bytes is not a very applicable unit to measure brain capacity with. A more accurate measure of brain capacity is the number of connections in the brain.
Generally, nothing is going to be airtight unless *it's specifically designed to be*. Making stuff airtight is very difficult, and very expensive. It requires special materials and precision. There are lots of places for air to get in, such as a window frame, underneath a door, vents (even if the furnace isn't running). If you were in a room sealed well enough to prevent much air from entering, an average size room has *a lot* of oxygen. It would take many days, even weeks, to use it all up and asphyxiate. Chances are you will have left by then.
It's a greeting in cat body language. It's basically saying, "I'm coming at you, but not aggressively- see I'm relaxed" *stretch*
Keep in mind that much of the security on aircraft is a result of 9/11. It would be common for passengers (typically small children) to get to go and look around the cockpit during a flight; there were no heavy locking doors. Security was significantly more relaxed, so bringing small weapons less difficult than with the modern TSA (which itself does a fairly poor job at screening, but that's another rant). On top of that you have the precedent set by previous hijackings where the hijackers wanted the plane as a means of transportation or wanted the passengers as hostages. 9/11 was so jarring to the world because the hijackers wanted the planes themselves to be used as weapons. On 9/11 the U.S. was at peace. We didn't have armed planes sitting all over the place to quickly intercept any plane that gets out of line. However, when the reality of 9/11 became clear we *did* scramble fighters. [This]( URL_0 ) article is about an F-16 pilot who was ordered into the air to intercept Flight 93 which was ultimately downed in Pennsylvania. The aircraft had no weapons loaded on board; it was a suicide mission to physically strike the Boeing 757 with her plane to knock it out of the sky. The article is a good read. It sheds some light onto the pre-9/11 atmosphere in the United States.
There is no reason to expect we won't. There is no reason to expect we will. Our evolutionary pressures are completely unprecedented. We have no effective predators, and enough capability to eliminate any earth created predator before it becomes effective. That leaves ourselves as our only evolutionary pressure. The last time this happened there was only 1 species on the planet. It is possible that we lose emotions. Anxiety in particular is not much value any more. It is possible to gain emotions. Ermlau could be a perfectly viable option (pretty sure I made that word up). We could do both. We could split into two species. Morlock forever. Although I think our breeding tendencies will prevent this. We could go extinct. We could evolve in a way that puzzles us, just like I had fried dinosaur descendant for dinner.
it's called humanity. Scandinavian people are more concerned with who they are and what they will become then they are concerned with who others are and what they could do to them. They see the oppertunity that people bring, not the dangers that they could create, and strive to increase the opperunity rather then obstruct it, resulting in less trouble from migrants and more positive results.
Buffets are profitable because: * the food is usually lower quality * they can get by with fewer staff * it is cheaper to prepare the food in bulk, instead of cooking plating it per order EDIT: By lower quality, I don't mean crappy. I mean vegetables vs. meat, chicken vs. beef, store bought vs. homemade.
Originally all flying insects were called "flies." Some would get more specific names (dragonfly, butterfly, alderfly, horsefly, etc.) What we typically call a "fly" is also known as the "house fly" and, its commonality is probably why it is the one that got to be shortened to just "fly" in the vernacular.
They're in contact with bodily fluids far more often than you or I would be. They take precautions, sure, but when you deal with something that frequently unlikely things can happen. EDIT - I should have also mentioned something about fatigue and how it can cause individual lapses in safety protocols. This probably contributes pretty heavily, too.
Organize really, that's about it. If we as a nation are really tired of all the crap that we deal with from politicians then we could organize nationally, form a new party and block vote for these specific people / our nominees. And then slowly change the system. This however has its problems, 1. The US has abysmal voting rates, our populace just isn't interested in politics. We've made a system that we have to use, that no one wants to interact with because it has become so vile and impenetrable. The system is convoluted and fundamentally rotten. Your average american either, A) doesn't have time to wrap their head around everything they feel like they need to know or B) Doesn't want to know because they think it all sucks. 2. The system uses first past the post voting / one person one vote [(watch this video by CGP Grey)]( URL_0 ). This system suppresses multiple party systems, with each person having only 1 vote, it empowers the leaders and discourages smaller groups from attempting to get a say in the system. **Example:** The Owl Party is fiscally conservative and the Hawk party is fiscally liberal, but supports foreign intervention. These are the two dominant parties Zylandia. A break away from the Hawk party wants fiscally liberal but is against foreign intervention. They want to vote for leaders who are like Hawks mostly, what they lack is popular vote because they are new. In First Past the Post / One Person One Vote systems, everyone gets only one vote, and similar candidates will share votes because there is a lot of overlap, so when a race is intra-party (Talon vs Hawk) it is okay. However with Interparty races people who would support the Talon party will feel pressured to vote for the Hawk Party representatives because the Hawk party has more wide spread support and without the support of the Talon party will lose against the Owl party. And Talons dislike Owls more than they dislike Hawks. Because Hawks and Talons are kind of similar, so it's better to get a Hawk in than an Owl. In a multi vote system a Talon supporter could vote for their Talon candidate as their primary vote, and then the Hawk candidate as a second choice. In this way people get to vote for who best exemplifies their beliefs without forcing them to choose between a loser and the dominant party. Forcing all people to vote into one person gives the group of citizens who are most stubborn extraordinary amount of power; ie: religious zealots. 3. Money, the current political system is coin operated, please insert hundreds of thousands of dollars to run for Senate Without fiscal support from wealthy donors or Super PACs many possible candidates cannot have competitive races simply because they cannot raise name awareness, hire employees, and combat attack advertisements. For us to have a truly representative nation for our citizens, our citizens should be able to vote for who they believe most represents themselves by both voting for the person, and voting for the political party, and for our potential politicians to work at on the same even ground. There is a reason why most of our top level politicians are from wealthy families. **tl;dr:** we need to organize nationally a new more important party than republican or democrat, under one agenda. That agenda is to fix the system so that it can be more representative of the citizenship of the U.S. This allows moderate and more hardline conservative and liberals to vote for their candidates without being controlled by small but powerful groups of people.
Have you ever held a can of compressed air while you pressed the trigger? The can gets really cold. When compressed gas is released the container cools. Imagine a loop of pipe. There is a very small valve on one side and a pump on the other. The pump pressurizes the coolant. The valve creates the same reaction of pressure being released. So the side where the pressure is released is cold, but the side with the pump is hot. That's why they put the hot pump on the outside (of the air conditioner or refrigerator). And the cold valve on the inside.
it's so bad because it does a shit job of what it's supposed to do, and makes people think that being searched and having no rights when you travel is a normal thing. it should be replaced with a handful of privately hired security guards, like we had before, and who were doing a fine job. nothing the TSA does right now would have prevented 9/11 from happening, yet that is reason we're given for their existence and the billions of dollars that are wasted on it. it's a completely horseshit infringement of people's rights, and worst of all, it does basically nothing to make us any safer. most of the people that work for the TSA are barely qualified to work at walmart.
There was a scientific trend in the past called Material Determinism that attempted to explain that the tropical regions were not as developed for reasons such as being warmer and thus making people lazy. This theory has been discredited a long time ago. There is no causation, even if there is some correlation.
Because you can get away with almost anything in this country if you claim it's against your religion. Parents have let their children die, literally die, because they didn't "believe" in modern medicine.
A lot of fish are overfished, and are considered commercially extinct, but not extinct as a species. Meaning there are insufficient stocks of fish to continue harvesting them. And as the food chain changes, because we've destroyed a layer of the food chain, a different species may take that position and make it permanently impossible for the original species to recover. The price of fish has gone up, farmed fish are helping replace that. For example, [Atlantic cod]( URL_0 ) is almost impossible to buy at market. Current harvests are about 1% of what was previously caught. Same goes for haddock, red drum, and a few others. White abalone is almost extinct, in 1980, it was about $2/lb, before the fishery was closed in 1995, it was selling for almost $15/lb. You should consider, it's cheaper now to grow farmed striped bass in the middle of the Arizona desert than it is to fish them in the oceans. That gives you a hint as to the scale of the problem.

Alcohol itself is extremely calorically dense. Doesn't really matter whether you're drinking a light beer or shots, alcohol itself has plenty of calories. Just think of every three shots as eating a mcdouble, with even less nutritional value.
Stagnating wages, skyrocketing cost of living, poor transportation and heavy traffic make the less-expensive suburbs very difficult to live in while working in the city. A huge increase in tuition costs resulting in everyone in their 20s being sacked with tens of thousands of dollars of debt.
They don't. That's why car racing often uses "racing slicks". The problem is that if you get even a little bit of something between the tire and the road (e.g. rain water) that there isn't anywhere for it to go, and it forms a film between the tire and the road that prevents the tire from getting any traction.
They'll hold you there until they find a way to translate, usually by radioing in for someone who speaks the language. Last year I was pulled over in Japan for speeding and didn't speak enough Japanese for them to be able to deal with me. It was in a rural area so there wasn't anyone at the nearby station who spoke fluent English, and it was summer, so I couldn't call my company to translate. In that case, they had a phrase book they used filled with common violations "Your charge is...[flips pages] speeding over the limit [flips pages] Your speed was 60kph [flips pages] the limit was 45." After that a bike cop with a nice cell phone pulled up and used google translate to explain how to pay my ticket. They didn't let me go until we both had a good understanding of what was going on.
The TPP is a trade liberalization treaty with investment and intellectual property provisions, we think. Lots of people will tell you why it's terrible. Maybe they're right. Here's the counterargument: Trade: Asian countries want to sell stuff, Western countries want to sell stuff, we all want to buy stuff. Right now there are innumerable rules limiting what companies and people in different countries can and cannot buy from each other. Trade agreements try to get rid of some of these rules. Why is this good? Because when you can sell to more people, you can make more money. There is also some orthodox (meaning accepted, not necessarily correct) economic theory that says that tariffs create a deadweight loss. None of this is new, the WTO (previously GATT) has existed for ages with the purpose of reducing trade barriers. Will this lead to more jobs going abroad? Maybe. More likely it will hurt low-skilled workers in countries that are better at high skilled things (I.e., if your country decides to specialize in high finance and Internet startups, its going to suck for your welders). Investment: These are the rules that let companies "sue" governments for losses. Basically, this is fine for the U.S. but can suck for developing countries. These rules basically say to countries "if we build a factory in your country, you can't just take it for no reason." Developing countries (and developed ones) actually do this from time to time, so the idea is that by promising not to just randomly take shit, countries will attract more foreign companies to invest (ideally creating jobs, paying taxes to the government etc). For companies, it's good because they get to invest in booming countries like Indonesia without as much risk that an irresponsible government will nationalize their money and kick them out on a whim. The problems with this are that 1 sometimes countries need to up and seize private property and 2 foreign investment isn't always as good as it looks in theory (generally developing countries covet foreign investment). In any case, most of the investment protections probably are already contained in other treaties. The U.S. has loads of bilateral investment treaties (look up BITs UNCTAD I'm too lazy to link on mobile). So does China. Japan does not have the same sort of investment protection regime, but the again most people seem to consider Japanese politics relatively stable. So there's your TPP. There's definitely some problems with it but the people who are losing their shit appear to be unaware of any of the developments in international economic law in the last 50 years. Edit: I forgot IP. A lot of developing countries don't have very strong protections for copyrights, patents, etc. American brands would probably like to see fewer rip offs of their products.
The other answers so far are incorrect - try putting a baby in an autorefractor and let me know how that goes for you. ;) For babies or nonverbal people, we can use something called a **retinoscope**. Basically we shine a light in the back of the eye and move it around, and based on how the reflection moves it tell us if you are far-sighted, near-sighted, or have good vision. If the reflection moves when we move the light, we know you have a refractive error and which one it is (far- or near-sighted). We then place different-powered lenses in front of the eye to "neutralize" or stop the movement. The lens that does that is your prescription. We can also use the same technique to determine if you have an astigmatism. Source: I am an optometry student. Edit: Since a lot of people are asking why don't we just make this standard instead of the "Which is better, 1 or 2?" thing we do: The answer is that retinoscopy is a *bit* less accurate than the regular "1 or 2" technique, but it can get us very close. The "1 or 2" is done to fine tune the prescription and make sure the patient is comfortable with the correction. Edit 2: If the 2 options the doctor gives you look the same to you, it's perfectly acceptable to say so. "They look the same" is a valid response.

Working memory can only handle a very small amount of information at a time, so closing your eyes does improve your hearing in the sense that it helps filter out distractions and increases recall for auditory information. Closing your eyes does not, however, increase the actual acuity of hearing.
Basically, Israel assassinated a high-ranking military leader from Hamas. This rather peeved Hamas. So, as retaliation, they launched ~400 missiles, some of them to Tel Aviv, but most of them in between Gaza and Tel Aviv. A lot of them were shot down by a defense system Israel has set up (called Iron Dome). As retaliation for THAT, Israel has started firing back with air strikes, and also some artillery/shelling from naval vessels. Israel said that it will also follow up with a ground invasion, if necessary, and has 75,000 troops at the ready to go in. Israel has hit a ton of targets, and said they had something like a couple hundred they wanted to hit (two of them were media buildings for news shows for example). Palestine has been launching a few rockets back (yesterday they launched at least 13-15 according to BBC), but they seem to be pretty outgunned. Current death toll stands at: 3 Israelis (2 men and a woman). 7 other people had to be treated for "shock" but that's not really much as far as injuries go. Can't seem to find any other stats. Around 58 Palestinians, anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 of which are civilians according to different sources, but at least 7 of which are confirmed to be children. Total injured is ~560. All numbers taken from BBC. Edit: [Here]( URL_0 ) is the link for the BBC article, and [here]( URL_1 ) is the wikipedia article for the current conflict. Edit 2: Death toll is now 69 in Gaza.

The comments about pus being a byproduct of infection and inflammation are quite right, although it's worth remembering that the creation of pus is specifically related to clearing infection from the body. White blood cells are attracted to the site of disease through processes like chemotaxis (migrating to sites that have high levels of chemicals either released by bacteria, or released by other white blood cells), and pus is formed as they engulf bacteria and then lyse/destroy them. All of the dead blood cells, bacteria and other breakdown products are what form pus (and by weight it's almost all white blood cells). Like most processes relating to infection, you can have too much of a good thing, and while the inflammatory response is necessary for healing, pus building up to the visible levels the OP is thinking of is a sign that infection is not under control. If pus collects into an abscess, it's best to drain it away - even if you are on antibiotics, the pH changes considerably in the middle of an abscess, and antibiotics may not penetrate to the middle or work as well. The belief that pus was necessary to healing is an old one, so the question is common - "laudable pus" was though to be a good part of healing and so encouraged until fairly recently in medical history!

It is, like many other things, based on a semi-humerous stereotype. From another site...  >  ... in 1947 in Detroit, Michigan — when police arrested a local man (James Hartford, Jr.) for beating his wife to death. Local news stations aired the arrest and elements of the case for months after — constantly showing a picture of Hartford, Jr. when he was arrested — wearing a dirty tank top with baked bean stains on it…and constantly referring to him as “the” wife beater.  >  From there, everything snowballed. From then on, men wearing dirty tank-topped undershirts were referred to as people who were “wearing wife-beaters” and the lexicon stuck from that point forward.
A big issue also revolves around freedom of choice. There's a fine line between making something illegal because it's dangerous and making something illegal because it's bad for you. People have the right to chose how they want to live their lives. Certain countries are making laws to control where smoking can happen so as to limit its effects on others
First, they had to divert away the water. This is usually done by building a tunnel upstream and letting the water flow through it instead of the construction site. Next, they form the dam and let the concrete set for a couple of weeks. After the concrete is sufficiently strong, the tunnel is plugged up and the water is directed back to the dam.
That should be pretty obvious... The dealers want their cut of the profit. -------------- This is a point I've tried to make for many, many years. A car is a Toaster. It's a product that can be sold at a Wal-Mart, at a cash register. Traditional car dealers don't want you to think like that.
Because you can't go to prison simply because the media or police suspect you belong to a crime family. They need to convince a jury that you've committed specific crimes. It's also worth noting that a lot of what we think we know about the current structure and membership of any given family is probably wrong or outdated. Joaquin Garcia noticed exactly this when infiltrating the mob for the FBI, and I believe Joe Pistone found the same thing.
Bees will just keep making honey forever, they don't need all of what's in their hive and in fact if they overstock enough, the hive gets too crowded and they swarm (leave to form a new hive somewhere else) and something like 75% of all swarms die. Collecting honey keeps the hive manageable for the bees. Also hives in human care are constantly monitored to make sure they have enough honey, don't get deadly mite infections, and don't get eaten by predators. A human-maintained hive is basically bee heaven. If you want to help save the bees, support your local beekeepers. Because we kinda need bees to survive; no bees means like 3/4 of our food crops can't be grown, cuz they require bees for pollination. source: my cousin's a beekeeper (he also brews mead from the honey from his hives).
So there are about a trillion stars in andromeda (the other galaxy) and 300 billion in the milky way. It's unlikely there will be even a single collision between stars, so it's incredibly unlikely a planet will collide with another planet and virtually certain earth will not be destroyed during the process. It's possible our whole solar system will be thrown out of the galaxy as a whole, but that probably won't have any major impacts on the earth-sun relationship. At that point all the water will have already boiled off the earth so I think it's pretty likely we won't be here anymore. Edit - million -- >  Billion
The layer of gravel on a low slope / flat roof is used to help keep the underlay fabric secured and to provide some protection from the elements and human interference. This roof type is typically composed of overlapping layers of tar paper or rubber sheeting separated by tar. Putting a thin layer of gravel (usually river gravel for the smooth edges) on top of the top tar layer will keep the tar from running as much during hot weather thus reducing the risk of a leak developing. It also provides a safer, cleaner, more stable footing for anyone on the roof, as well as protecting the roof from that person's weight. It keeps hailstones, errant baseballs, etc. from damaging the waterproof seal created by the paper and tar, as well as helping to keep the layers in place. Flat roofs in my experience are seldom totally flat. Most of the ones I have been up on had a tiny bit of slope to them to feed water to the edges for removal.

The clear liquid is known as a supersaturated solution. In this case, of sodium acetate. By using only a little water, the maximum amount of solid is dissolved when it's hot. When it cools down, it ought to crystalize out but it can't because there's nothing to start the them off. When some crystals are added they act as centres for more molecules to form round. But there's something else too. Sodium acetate, like many substances, incorporates molecules of water in its crystals - in this case three per molecule, a trihydrate. So when it crystalizes it uses up all the water in the mix so the whole thing goes solid instead of forming a slush. That's why the second demo forms a solid pillar as you pour the solution onto the stuff that's crystalized already. ETA If you try it yourself make sure that the equipment is clean, particularly the jar you pour the hot solution into to cool. Dust, or even scratches on the glass, can be places where crystalization can start before you're ready to put the "seed" in.

What many people dont understand is that black holes are not more "powerful" when it comes to their gravitational effect on other objects than any other object in space. If you would take 1kg of matter and compress it as much as matter is compressed in a black hole, you would get an event horizon and all that but standing next to this 1kg black hole would not affect you in any other way than what the same mass already did to you before it was compressed. tl;dr black holes are just dense matter, they move around in space like everything else.

Coke sells way more soda by volume than Pepsi. As a response, Pepsi offers its products to restaurants at a reduced cost, which is why many restaurants carry it. But only up to midscale places -- no nice restaurant serves Pepsi, because Coke has more cachėt, and also you need it for mixed drinks. Note also that McDonald's, the single biggest restaurant chain in the world, serves Coke.
A lot of it is setup that takes place before any production begins - hiring people, finding actors, locations, etc. A tv show has to do that just once - just like in movies, except they get to reuse all of those resources in every episode.
Okay, so whenever you have your eyes open you can see your nose, right? But most of the time you don't even notice it, only when you actually think about it. Your brain gets a lot of information at the same time. You feel your clothes, see your surroundings and so on, all at the same time. Because it is hard work to save all those informations some stuff gets ignored, just like your nose. Now think of your dreams as the nose. Dreams are not important to your brain after they happened so the memory gets deleted quickly. You can usually remember it for a few minutes after waking up but it goes away quickly. Now, just like you can think about your nose and then see it, you can start thinking about your dreams and keep them memorized! If you concentrate on them, you tell your brain that they are important and it will save them. This can be trained btw.
Fascism doesn't mean "very authoritarian". Rather, it's a particular flavour of authoritarianism — the communist dictatorships are most definitely not fascist, as anti-communism is one of the pillars of fascism! Fascism was, amongst other things, anti-religious (though they eventually toned that down), whereas both Portuguese and Spanish dictatorships appealed strongly to a catholic base. Fascism is anti-conservatism, while both Franco and Salazar were quite conservative. While they were both right-wing dictatorships (and, therefore, shared more similarities with Fascism than they did with communist dictatorships), they didn't quite go along with all the tenets of Fascism.
Google makes its money by selling ads, having YouTubr and Chrome available on iOS furthers this goal. Apple makes its money by selling hardware, iPhone and macs. Having itunes / other apply software available on Android doesn't further this goal. So they don't do it. There is no cost incentive. Apple benefits from having you totally involved in their ecosystem - Google benefits from their ecosystem being included everywhere
They don't have a concept of names the way we do, but they do recognize it as our way of getting their attention and know to respond to it. Edit: Surprised at how this thread took off.. there's a difference between knowing a word and who or what to associate it with (ex: a dog knowing your whole family by their names) and understanding the concept of the words. I think my dog is a special brilliant magical creature, and he "knows" his name, but I don't think he actually understands that it is him, or who he is. That said, this thread makes me want to put a wig on him and film a cover of "Reflection" from Mulan. *Who is that dog I see...*
The busiest highway in the US was shut down for a short period of time for renovations, causing a ton of media outlets to nickname it "carmaggedon", seeing as the huge amounts of traffic that was normally present on the freeway would now be even more congested on detour routes. It's funny. [Here's a helpful wikipedia blurb.]( URL_0 )
Because a simmer is just as hot (within a few degrees) and much more controllable. It won't smash delicate tortellini apart and won't splash or overflow violently.
Meth makes you really really happy. More happy than you could ever get without drugs. But it also reduces your ability to become happy. It very quickly reaches a point where you *have* to keep using meth, because you can never really feel happy without it.
There are other similar ones such as going to church/school/bed. The distinction between those and things like the grocer, is that they convey the idea of being in a certain state. e.g. I'm going to church vs I'm going to the church. The first implies you are going to church for Sunday service or similar. The second just means you are going to the physical church building. I'm not sure why they diverged on some things like hospital but not others. Edit: to add... so in the UK we might say, I'm going to THE hospital (to visit my friend), but I'm going to hospital (for surgery)
My understanding is that so long as the bullet isn't lodged in a very active muscle (i.e. diaphragm) or obstructing something in a way that cant be worked around, they simply isolate the bullet, stop the bleeding, and close up. Very rarely is it like the movies, where they go digging for the bullet above stopping the bleeding, and the moment the bullet comes out, that person will be ok. There are so many other factors at work, such as hydraulic shock, shattered bone that's been displaced by the entry, the exit wound, which can be several times the size of the entrance wound, severed arteries or damage to critical organs such as the liver, lungs, stomach and heart. Sometimes this means removing a section of intestine, relieving pressure in the chest from internal bleeding/lung suction to drain fluids etc, and all are a bigger worry than a 9mm slug that will sit lodged in muscle for a while, until the body grows around it and/or develops an infection, in which case secondary operation will be required. thirdly, depending on the caliber of the firearm; a 9mm parabellum will pass straight through most points from under 15 meters IIRC, a .45 ACP will ALMOST run out of energy, a .357 magnum will go straight through, leaving no bullet to remove, and most rifle cartridges from the same range, it's often hydraulic shock that kills first. I actually asked a surgeon about it a while ago and whilst he said he'd been lucky enough in 20 years to not have to attend to a GSW, he had heard, learned/read (was high as a kite on morphine at the time) that stopping the bleeding and restoring the bodies processes are primary, removing the projectile is secondary. Oftentimes they'll operate to stabilise, then operate a second time to remove if necessary. tl;dr: forget bullets, air goes in and out, blood goes round and round, any variation on these must be attended to.
The side effect isn't as direct as your post title makes it seem. Rather it goes like this: A heavily depressed person has suicidal thoughts/tendencies, however the depression is so deep that it negates the will/drive to do anything, including committing suicide. On starting the therapy, the therapist realizes that any treatment will fail due to the absolute lack of drive and deep seated melancholia. He prescribes antidepressants. They work as intended and increase the depressive persons activity level, thus making them theoretically "fit" for treatment. However in doing so, the pharmaceuticals also increased the likelihood of suicide as the treated person now has enough drive/motivation to act, including potentially acting on their suicidal tendencies. TL:DR Sometimes the only thing keeping a depressed person from committing suicide, is their total lack of drive to act. Antidepressants may work just well enough to up the drive but not well enough to remove the suicidal tendencies.
Blue eyes are what are called Autosomal recessive (this isn't necessarily 100% true, but it is good enough we can work with it). Autosomal recessive means that both alleles (meaning genes that you get from your parents) need to be recessive in order to be expressed in the offspring. Now lets say that this blue eyed person's alleles are represented by 'rr'. A person needs two little 'r's, one from the father and one from the mother, to have blue eyes. Here's where it gets interesting. Father and Mother do not need to have blue eyes to necessarily have a blue eyed kid. If Mom has a Brown eyed allele and blue eyed allele, she will have brown eyes, but still carry a blue eyed gene, or what we would write as 'Rr'. If the father has the same 'Rr' pattern, then there is 1/4 chance of one of their kids getting 'rr' and having blue eyes. Also, they will have a 1/2 chance of getting a kid with 'Rr', meaning the gene is still present, even if it isn't being expressed. A one more point before I wrap up with an answer. Since blue eyes do not necessarily put a person at risk of early death in the wild, they are not selected against in population. The lack of disadvantage means that the likelihood of someone with blue eyes living as long as someone with brown eyes is pretty good, and increases the chances of a blue eyed person mating with another blue eyed person, or a brown eyed person with an 'r' allele. You could even argue that blue eyes are selected for in modern populations, as some consider those with blue eyes more attractive and therefore increase that person's chances of mating (although the applicability of that could definitely be questioned). In short Because a gene can be carried without being expressed in a person, it can survive a surprising amount of time without ever showing up as a blue eyed person. All it takes to express that gene is one other person with that recessive allele to mate with them, and a blue eyed person can be born. And because blue eyes are not usually selected against in nature, when someone does appear with blue eyes they are just as likely to mate as any other member of the population, increasing the chances of persistence in population. Edit: I should have probably made this a bit more clear, eye color is not 100% controlled by one gene, it is controlled by quite a few genes that give each eye a unique hue and pattern. Eye color as whole however does work pretty well in models for autosomal traits.
1) Senators are normally seated in January. The race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman was very close (~300 votes). This led to recounts, which led to lawsuits, which led to more recounts. Al Franken (who would've been #60) was not seated until July 7. 2) Ted Kennedy was dying and had not cast a vote since April 2009 or so. After he died in August 2009, he was replaced by Paul G. Kirk until a special election could be held. Due to more lawsuits, Paul G Kirk served from Sept 24 2009 to February 4 2010. Scott Brown (R) won that special election, bringing the Senate Democrats down to 59 votes, and unable to break a filibuster by themselves. Note that Sept 24-Feb 4 is about 20 working days, due to recess and holidays. 3) So, for about 20 working days, the Senate Democrats could have broken a filibuster if you could get every single one of them to agree on something. This is not an easy thing to do. Some of the members had ideological differences. Some of the members realized that being absolutely vital like this gave them leverage, and wanted to be sure that they got *their* legislative goals. This did not go well.
Yes, you're downloading pages as you browse. The difference, as far as I know, is: - **Browsing** downloads the page to a temporary location, which will be removed when you delete your browser history or cache. - **Downloading** loads to page or file to a true destination for later, offline use (often the /Downloads folder).
They don't switch just because a new president arrives. Air Force One is piloted by Air Force pilots (typically O-6, O-5 or O-4 - very senior guys - it's a high profile gig) and each tour of duty (like the rest in the military) typically lasts 3-5 years, so they will naturally rotate out over time during a presidency and overlap with multiple Presidents depending on timing in their career. edit: Here's a great National Geographic Documentary on this and what goes into planning each mission:  URL_0  edit2: /u/since_ever_since mentioned that only full bird (O-6) colonel's could be Aircraft Commander of AF1. The other pilots/navigators could be lower ranks. It is a prestigious gig, so pilots are typically selected for it as a good deal tour of duty
Because of your culture. In comparison, here in germany it's the other way around. We're more lax on the sex and nudity, but violence, gore and the like get the boot.
 >  So for me cloning sounds like an amazing opportunity to start from scratch and have a normal life. You do know cloning doesn't work like that, right? Cloning is just a way to make a baby with the same DNA as its "parent". This baby is an entirely separate individual, it still needs to grow, and despite having the same DNA it can still have a completely different personality, based on its life experiences.
People are pattern seeking in nature. When someone stumbles upon a pattern, they can start to connect the dots. However, we all have biases, and many people connect the dots in a biased way (usually in regards to some fantasy they would like to see acted out). Now, let's just say you are an auto mechanic. You watch the news, you see things getting "worse" in the world. You don't like the president, you don't like the pope, you feel stuck in a rut. You don't have a cool car like the guy down the street, or a big house like your older brother. You kind of wish something exciting would happen, or the world would flip around a little bit so you can see something entertaining that takes you away from the mundane. Many people want to latch on to these theories because they see the dots connected by some biased person that leads them down a path to a conclusion. This conclusion would seem nonsensical to the average person, but delve into a blog, or a book with all these patterns shown, and you somehow feel enlightened. You feel like the more you know, the safer you will be when the day comes that the NWO takes over. It's just a doomsday fantasy. It's something that will draw you out of your boring life. To not be biased, there is also the possibility that these conspiracies are true. Just stay informed, and don't trust information you see that is not scientific or does not have a credible source. There are also documentaries debunking most of the conspiracies out there. I just watch plenty of the Discovery Channel and National Geographic, and you see these programs on all the time.
iPhone 9 got explained by different comments, but the actual story behind Windows is far more interesting. It seems due to some sloppy programming, there is a bunch of MS applications which are checking the version of OS by verifying if it begins with '9' (to differentiate between Windows 95/98 and later versions, which have a different architecture). So they had to skip Windows 9 because of the risk it would be accidentally treated as an old Windows version by some apps, causing compatibility issues.
I am dyslexic and it is actually quite commonly said that dyslexia doesn't exist in China, it's a bit more complex than that, but basically, the characters do not affect dyslexics in the same way as letters do. These are a few interesting links that should tell you more, firstly an article about someone who is severely dyslexic in English but not at all in Japanese -  URL_1  The second is an article on the discovery that chinese 'dyslexics' actually suffer from a deficiency in a totally different part of the brain to english ones -  URL_0 
***Real Simplified Version:*** PRISM is a tool used by the NSA that allows analysts to view data ("foreign intelligence") collected by legal methods. **Edit 5:** I apologize that this edit precedes the rest of the post, but much of the information from the original post has proven itself to be "outdated" (read: inaccurate) insofar as it incorrectly attributed power to PRISM, when it is at most a part of the whole. To be strictly correct, PRISM ("Planning Tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization, and Management") itself is simply the name of a tool used to access data gathered by the NSA by presumably legal means (in accordance with FISA / Protect America Act). I have now edited the post for accuracy. Be aware that as more information has come out, much of the related speculation has been disproved, at least so far as PRISM itself is concerned, and the articles upon which this post was originally based are themselves no longer the latest information on the subject. ------------ Ok, for now I've finished editing. I've removed all the inaccurate information I could find, and replaced most of the original post with the most accurate information I could find, to the best of my knowledge. Please bring any inaccuracies you find to my attention. ------------ Below is a slightly abridged version of the highlights from the following article: [CNET FAQ]( URL_1 ) This has replaced the previously posted information as it was not accurate. **What is PRISM?** PRISM stands for "Planning Tool for Resource Integration, Synchronization, and Management," and is a "data tool" designed to collect and process "foreign intelligence" that passes through American servers. It has now been acknowledged by the Obama administration. In the words of national security reporter Marc Ambinder, "PRISM [is] a kick-ass GUI that allows an analyst to look at, collate, monitor, and cross-check different data types provided to the NSA from Internet companies located inside the United States." **It only targets foreigners?** PRISM "cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen (PDF), or any other U.S. person, or to intentionally target any person known to be in the United States, according to a statement released by Director Clapper on June 8. **So how does this affect an American's data?** The key word is intentional. The NSA can't intentionally target an Americans data. But analysts need only be at least 51 percent confident of a target's "foreignness." **What is PRISM not?** It is apparently not the name for an overarching secret surveillance program in affiliation with certain large tech companies, as was originally reported by The Washington Post. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has released a statement saying, "PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program." Instead, the name PRISM appears to refer to the actual computer program used to collect and analyze data legally requested by the NSA and divulged by Internet companies. This matches reports from CNET and The New York Times. However, as the New York Times reported late Friday evening, it has come to light that the nine large tech companies first reported to be working with the NSA to divulge information have, in fact, made it easier for the government to access data from their servers. **Which companies are involved?** Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, Google, Apple, PalTalk, YouTube, and Skype. Dropbox is allegedly "coming soon." However, 98 percent of PRISM production is based on just Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft. All nine of them have explicitly denied that the government has "direct access" to their servers. Reliable sources have confirmed to CNET that PRISM works on a request-by-request basis, rather than unfettered access, as was originally reported by the Washington Post. Here is a direct quote from our in-depth article on this issue:  > Those reports are incorrect and appear to be based on a misreading of a leaked Powerpoint document, according to a former government official who is intimately familiar with this process of data acquisition and spoke today on condition of anonymity. **So someone has read my e-mail?** Aside from the fact that Google's algorithms crawl your e-mail all the time to target ads at you, "someone" within the NSA/FBI/etc may have read your e-mails, *presumably with a proper warrant*. **Should I be outraged?** Probably! But maybe not. President Obama addressed PRISM on Friday and essentially said, "Don't worry. You can trust us." **Is it even legal?** Yes, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 2008 and the Protect America Act of 2007. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released a statement Thursday night saying that "Section 702 is a provision of FISA that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States." FISA was renewed last year by Congress. **How does it work?** Essentially like this: The attorney general issues a secret order to a tech company to hand over access to its servers to the FBI. The FBI then hands that information over to the NSA. This account matches what CNET has been told by our reliable source:  > When the government delivers Section 702 orders, according to a former official, companies "implement them just as though they would implement a wiretap -- there's no direct access to servers." The order has to be for account information or an intercept directed at a specific foreign person, and "you can't say everyone in Pakistan who searched for 'X'... It still has to be particularized." According to CNET's source, both the contents of communications and metadata, such as information about who's talking to whom, can be requested. **What's the fallout?** Well, so far respected human rights watchdog Freedom House has downgraded America's freedom ranking. Last time their survey was released, the United States was the second most free country on Earth in terms of Internet freedoms. That position is about to change. **How can I avoid this?** You can't. **What happens next?** A congressional hearing and an investigation into who leaked it. "The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans," Clapper said in his statement. So the answer is, nothing much.

Comments are mostly right. The bit being missed is that people aren't always trading gold. Mostly they're trading certificates that say you own some gold somewhere. This is important mostly because real gold trades take time - you need to check purity and arrange safe shipping. That slows trades and smoothes out price movements. The shift to trading gold certificates made it more like shares - subject to herd trading and short term trading.
The difficulty here is the ineffable nature of the psychedelic experience. As a simplified analogy, imagine going to the doctor and having a pain in a part of your body that you can't name. You have to resort to demonstration and pointing to get the doctor to understand. The psychedelic experience is sort of like that in parts, you feel and experience things that you don't have a word for, and the only way to point it out to someone is for them to also experience it. Ego death is the pinnacle of this scenario, where all that was explainable and definable as 'you', is no more. I've never had ego death, but even in my limited LSD experience I know i've felt things that I couldn't explain here in words. I think that's going to make your ELI5 difficult, or impossible, to answer.
martial law. locals are not happy with the government. Protests planned for this Friday - Sunday. Ex Pats living in Bangkok don't seem too concerned - just staying away from major areas. Pizzas and DVD's for a few days.
Your fingers are controlled by tendons while your arms are controlled mainly by muscles. Tendons can possibly damage over long-term use, while muscles regenerate after microtears and get stronger. Muscles have a type of regeneration that adapts to heavier things over time. Tendons, not so much.
I've heard that people cover their mouths when something shocking happens because they are subconsciously trying to slow their breathing by increasing the CO2 concentration in their inhaled breath. Bit like breathing into a paper bag when you are hyperventilating. I know it's not what OP asked but thought it was interesting anyway.
Hair length is dependent on how long each hair lives in a certain area. On your head hair can live for years before it dies and eventually falls out. Arm and leg hair might only last a month or so, so it stays short. tl;dr Your hair is always growing, it is how often it falls out that makes it stay short, or allows it to become long.
Imagine you're in a building with 20 floors. Someone in floor 2 decided to click "floor 20", so the elevator isn't gonna stop going up until it hits floor 20. Let's say you're in floor 4 and want to go to floor 3. If you pick this elevator, you'll do 4 - >  20 - >  3. So, avoiding this elevator by only pressing the "down" button, you'll catch an elevator going down, and you'll do straight from 4 to 3.
Has to do with Longitudes **Edit** and Agencies. from 140°W longitude to 180°W longitude the storms are called hurricanes, and they are monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. past 180°W in the pacific they are called a typhoon and they are monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as well as the Japan Meteorological Agency **EDIT** I have no idea where the Cyclone Vs Typhoon split is. Sorry.
I was super interested in this a while back and did some research. Obviously we can't study this kind of thing humanely, but there is anecdotal evidence of some consciousness (pretty much always the head the head just sort of looks around in shock/fear) from the guillotine and one story I remember reading about an Iraq (Afghanistan?) veteran talking about a friend whose head was removed during an attack. The most interesting example was some guy (don't remember who it was, hopefully some other commenter will help me out here) who knew he was going to be executed and told the executioner he would try to say something when his head was off. He didn't, but the executioner called his name several times and the head did look at the man each time. Also, if I remember correctly, it takes 4-7 seconds to go unconscious due to cutting off the blood supply if you are hanged without breaking your neck (also unsure about this statistic, sorry for all these parentheses but like I said I was interested in this a while ago and have forgotten a lot). I believe that 4 seconds also comes up in rats who are decapitated. I made that (very unscientific) connection on my own, but it seems logical that your brain needs a few seconds without blood supply before it entirely powers down and 4 seconds is the number that seems to come up the most. If you think about it, it doesn't really make sense that you would die literally INSTANTLY, since nothing has actually happened to your brain and it is likely going to die due to blood loss. Anyway, the little evidence I found seems to point to the fact that the brain is still working, but you're probably in too deep a state of shock and the time frame too small for you to actually do or think of anything (other than maybe pure shock/fear) as demonstrated by the fact that shocked or painful looks are the only things that come up in even the most fantastic of stories and by the one guy who actually did try and fail to do something more. As far as things like heartbeat and breathing, those are involuntary and still happen in a state of shock, so I imagine your brain is still sending those signals to the neck, though obviously no one is listening.
A few possibilities. 1. The pill actually is lodged. Fairly uncommon but some people have difficulties swallowing pills. 2. The pill rubbed/scratched against the back of your throat and you're feeling that, not the pill. 3. Psychosomatic. There's no pill but the thought/idea/fear of the pill getting lodged is causing the sensation.
dopamine / Adrenaline stuff doesn't sit well with me, it doesn't really play a role in WHY you feel sleepy. 2 Hours of studying requires extensive use of the brain centers which releases a host of different kinds of neurotransmitters that stimulate long term potentiation. Skyrim on the otherhand, does not really utilize the brain at all that much. All you are doing in skyrim is the same old practiced routines over and over again. Probably the first couple times of playing skyrim, you had trouble playing for 5 hours a day, until you practiced it enough to be easy. It's kind of like a baby walking. First couple of times, only 2 minutes a day. Now, you can walk for hours. Same stuff, just practiced until you aren't really thinking anymore.
The expiration date from the milk is no longer relevant. Your cake will have the same shelf regardless of whether you used milk expiring tomorrow, or milk expiring much later, because you have killed all the bacteria that were going to make the milk spoil.
Essentially when a dog does that, they're saying "I want to play with you" in dog. That's why you shouldn't bow down to talk to your dog, especially when they're in trouble because your voice says bad dog, but your body language says, let's dick around dude.
Here is an incredible answer by /u/corpuscle634 when this was asked a year ago in [this thread]( URL_1 ). **Edit: /u/corpuscle634 has updated his original answer in the original thread, so please take a look at his answer in that thread for a more complete and accurate answer. Here is a direct [link]( URL_0 ).** **The TL:DR of it is: If you give energy to something without mass, the only form it can take is motion - you can't have a stationary massless particle, since mass literally is "the energy something has when it isn't moving." Photons have no mass, so they're never stationary.** And if that's still too complicated here's a shorter answer from /u/kvandy15: "The speed of anything is basically determined by it's weight and the amount energy that is pushing it. You can push your toy cars really fast but if you try to push a real car it's a lot harder. That's because it weighs more. Light weighs nothing, so it moves at full speed all the time with no push at all."
VHS is an analog system, meaning that the data does not consist of bits and bytes, but of a continuously-varying signal. In most cases, you can't make exact copies of analog signals. You can make copies that are "close enough" to the original, but with tiny, *tiny* amounts of variation. But if you make copies of copies of copies, those tiny variations build on top of one another, until they're the only data left.
Organs can function adequately without nerve connections. As long as they're hooked up to the plumbing (i.e. blood flow) many of them will function just fine. With limbs, the primary purpose of them is to respond to nerve impulses, either sensory or motor (i.e. feeling and moving). Connecting nerves is tricky even when it's re-attaching your own extremities. Transplanting someone else's onto yours is turning the difficultly up to 11. There has been some success with transplanting extremities, but they have nowhere near full function capability.

They live in a unit on the ground floor. Other inmates help push them places, or help them up steps if needed. But they're pretty wheelchair accessible, with only additional living space (cells) in upper levels. I've rarely seen steps into buildings. Every place inmates go is concrete and even if it's on a hill, there's a walkway, not steps. Source: former employee of a prison.
"Remembering" a face really only involves recognition memory. This means that you don't need to be able to bring the face to mind from nothing, you just need to be able to say, "yes, I have seen this face before." Recognition memory is automatic and requires minimal processing. Remembering a name involves a more difficult process. Long-term memory, especially that for words, works best with meaningful information. There is nothing meaningful about the association between someone's name and their face; names are arbitrary. This makes names very difficult to remember, and success requires effortful processing. In general, no normal person is naturally better at remembering names than anyone else. It's a difficult task and some people just pay more attention or use better strategies.
Yes. You can accept a gift from a foreign government. Officers of the United States (such as the President) need the consent of Congress to do so.
* Better lawyers * Often have positive contribution to society to become celebrities, so better prospects of rehabilitation * More money = easier rehabilitation for things like addiction/violence * Reputation damage is often seen as a large punishment which 'normal' people don't have
Farms don't use treated city water, they use well water. They dig a big hole and bury a $2000 pump at the bottom and they have all the groundwater under their property for 30 years or so. It's vastly cheaper than the cleaned and fluoridated wonder-water we feed humans, because we really don't care if our cows have bad teeth. There's a lot of controversy about cows and water, but it's important to remember that water doesn't travel all that well. Most places in the Americas have excess water, with great underground flows carrying rainwater out to sea. Farms in non-arid parts of the world do not change the level of the water table, and pose no environmental or water hazard. A cow raised outside Seattle can drink and drink and not make a lick of difference because there's just so much water that feed rather than water becomes the limiting agent on raising them there. If you're concerned about California's water situation and think farmers are to blame, go ahead and boycott beef grown in southern states. That's probably an ecologically sound move. But Montana doesn't have a water crisis, and saving their water by not eating their beef isn't going to help anyone.
If the premise is true, it may be because masculinity is (in some cases) more rigidly defined, leading to a greater conflict between people who insist on traditional masculinity and males who don't adhere to it than between people who are fond of traditional femininity and females who don't adhere to it.
America pretty much does what the fuck it wants.
Because womens is the same but slightly dialed back. People want to see the fastest, hardest hitting, most amazing spectacles and that usually means men's because of physiological differences making men more able to perform those feats
Eating, among other pleasureable things like having sex releases the hormone dopamine, also known as the pleasure hormone, that like you might have guessed makes you happy. The dopamine then relieves some of the stress, making you feel better by eating.
Australia wants to assume the mantle of regional power. By doing this it shows "We take care of our own, Malaysia owes us nothing but earmarking 100m is what regional powers can and will do to it's smaller neighbours". It's a show of power wrapped in solidarity. By helping Malaysia this way, future leaders of Malaysia will gravitate towards Australia and help it in establishing a local power group with Australia at it's head.
Beyond the mutual grooming behavior cats also enjoy licking humans for the salt we excrete with our sweat. Your arms are like a big bag of potato chips to this cat.
It is, In space. down here on earth though, it's not, and since that's where the term comes from, it stuck.
*TL;DR*: **It's not all about money**. There's all sorts of different reasons why it's worth shelling out a lot more cash for. A big one is pride due to social expectations. There's a certain negative and slightly embarrassing status associated with living at home versus a more adult-seeming being-in-charge of your own surroundings when you're living in a bachelor pad or equivalent. It's doubly so when your peer group of friends or workmates all have their own places and you don't have the freedom to invite them over. Ditto the mooching aspect of being a stay-at-home adult/child. Eventually, to a lot of people, it just doesn't seem... right or fair and so they move out. And we as humans want to "own" stuff, and be able to look around at our own little spot and say "this is mine because I'm paying for it / renting it out of my own pocket." Some people find that being too close to their parents eventually drive them nuts. They want to live a certain way or not have any limitations on their behaviors. But there's often conditions on having someone else's roof over your head and those eventually become too onerous. OP asked about this from an American perspective, and so it's quite appropriate that one of the key reasons is "freedom". :) Others reach a point in a relationship where it's too clumsy and confined to enjoy that relationship at their parents. Most parents don't appreciate their kid having a sex-buddy in their bedroom for a whole weekend. Thumpthumpthump from the second floor becomes old rather quickly. The parents have a say too, particularly if they're approaching retirement. "Junior, get the hell out so we can live our own life and we won't have to waste our limited money on feeding you!". They want the house to look and feel the same as before they left for that one-week tour in the camper, not come home to an empty fridge and an unwashed sinkful of dishes.
Metal was valuable so both the winners of the battle and afterwards the locals would go and search for any and either reuse the equiptment, melt or reforge the parts or sell them.
I don't know that there is any ONE DEFINITIVE way an album can be well produced. There are pros and cons to different styles and everyone is going to have their preference. One example is the "loudness war."  URL_0  Over the years many producers have been pushing to make all things as loud as possible for every element of the song. This makes listening in the car or on a crappy radio nice because you don't have to reach for the volume to pick up on all the subtle elements (or be surprised by explosive percussion). However, in a quiet room with average speakers the difference is noticeable; with nuanced mixing the producer can draw your attention to different aspects of the song. For example, a drum solo can shake your windows or a unique instrument can take the forefront. If everything is the same volume it is easy to be quickly fatigued by the wall of noise.
It has to do with money. Lots of people are usually willing to pay money to see a sports game. Fewer people are willing to pay to see the band play. The sports team and band are like investments. The sports team usually has better returns. Build a bigger stadium, get more people at a game. Pay for a better coach, get a better team, get more people at a game. Get more people at a game, get more money. If bands made more money for a school than the sports teams, the band would get more money.
This animal eats plants. You don't have to move fast to catch them. There are many predators that prey on deer, but luck is still a possible explanation. Shock doesn't always kill you, and prey animals like this are generally tougher than predators like humans.
There have been attempts, but they mostly haven't been very funny. Fox News premiered a show called The 1/2 Hour News Hour sometime during the Bush administration which was an attempt at a Daily Show-style show, but no one watched it. They currently have The Greg Gutfield Show, which is their attempt at a Bill Maher/Politically Incorrect style panel show blending political commentary and comedy. It is close to unwatchable.
There are several types of tears: basal (automatic/lubricating), reflex (sawdust/onion in the eye), and emotional (tears of sorrow, fear, joy, etc.). Each is triggered differently and has a slightly different chemical makeup. They also involve different muscle groups and timing, but all can, to varying extent, be manipulated. Personal observation: My lachrimal ducts and glands were damaged/destroyed in a traumatic incident, so my basal tear production is effectively nil-- a real problem for someone who must wear contact lenses to see effectively. But I've learned to keep my eyes wet by briefly mimicing the facial expressions I had and felt when I was able to cry. (Lots of practice in front of a mirror isolating and contracting facial muscle groups, helped along by genuine frustration.) Having suffered several major physical traumas in my life, I've found that emotional crying doesn't really help relieve physical pain, and is often a real distraction from the work of immediate survival. Of course, the emotional release of crying in the *aftermath* of trauma can be a huge comfort, but the actual tears are generated by fear and frustration, not physical pain.
They let out a web string and let it flow on the wind. The string is sticky, so as soon as it touches the other tree, it attaches there. Afterwards the spider can use that string as a base to create the rest of the web.
Because it's not possible for the users to raise the space themselves and because no other company sells iPhones, they are able to ask whatever they want. So they do.
The federal government can, and has, sent troops to enforce SCOTUS rulings (desegregation, for instance). I believe the federal government can also arrest and try members of the executive branch of the State government for their violations.
Those are his symbols of office. Putting them on the table means he's not acting like a cop anymore, and is willing to break the rules in this interrogation.
Since the process of 'tarnishing', or corrosion, is a redox reaction between the metal and oxygen and water, an incredibly stable and unreactive element such as gold will not be affected. **Edit:** As /u/nickbrisola pointed out, I should also say that gold is a 'passivating' metal. These types of metal react with oxygen to form an impervious oxide layer that prevents from any water or oxygen to be in contact with the metal, hence preventing corrosion. Other examples of such metals include Aluminium and Chromium. The opposite of these metals are known as 'active' metals and include Iron and Magnesium - which can be easily corroded.
International Plumbing Code and Uniform Plumbing Code in the US dictate that open front seats must be used for facilities that are made for Accessible Design. The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't require it but plumbing code does. Nobody really likes open front seats so you usually only see them in commercial applications in the US. Home use toilet seats are closed front because that is much more comfortable for non disabled users.
I am not a chrome expert, but there are a number of possible reasons: The biggest offender is probably the chrome sandbox. To limit the damage should someone figure out how to hack the browser, each "tab" is walled off from the others by running each in a separate process. Part of the increased security comes from the processes having separate memory. The downside is that each tab is essentially a full copy of the application, and that results in a lot of redundant memory usage. Another is likely to be memory management strategy. It takes computing power to go off and free the ram when you're done using it. In a language like javascript this typically means halting execution and looking for objects which are no longer needed. What this means is that it makes more sense to wait until you're out of memory before you go off trying to free some up. I know there are (at least used to be) places in the code where the javascript engine would intentionally leak memory on shutdown because it's faster for the OS to dismiss it (on exit) then to go through a full shutdown. tl;dr - It's probably some combination of security sandboxing and memory management strategy. edit: It looks like someone else already mentioned [sandboxing]( URL_0 ).
In the USA we're protected to freely assemble for any reason so long as it's peaceful. Any group of people can get together and do whatever they want so long as it's not harming anyone or breaking any laws. So, just like Lutherans can get together every Sunday and sing songs and recite prayers in unison, so can Scientologists. Cults are protected, just like all other groups, under the First Amendment. So, until Scientology breaks some laws they won't get disbanded - and even if they do break laws it's likely only those specific people involved will get charged with a crime. Check out Wikipedia's [Legality of Cults (Bottom of the page)]( URL_0 ) page.
It's actually quite the opposite. Your body is making a hell of a lot of noise (rest your head on someone's stomach some time), which your brain filters out. A disorder of the inner ear called superior canal dehiscence syndrome causes people to hear these sounds - including the sound of their eyeballs moving. Noises that aren't made internally (like tapping your teeth) pass through the solid matter in your head and manually stimulate the ossicles - which your brain can't filter out.
The T-pose is the easiest way to model and rig a character - just extrude the polygons at the sides of the chest to create arms, when rigging the character the bones can be placed flat in a line. Unfortunately, while it's the easiest way to model a character, it also creates awful topology at the shoulders since it's a completely unnatural pose, with no defined shoulder blades. That perhaps didn't matter so much when the model in question is low poly, as older video game characters were, [but higher poly models with more accurate anatomy will more commonly be modelled in a more natural pose where the arms are around 45-degrees from the body.]( URL_0 )
White supremacists had everyone believing that black folks were inferior, disgusting, half - beast people. In their minds, drinking from a black persons water fountain was like sticking your head in a horse trough.
To explain, I'll first give the letter-note idea a try: For one thing, there's more than one of each note name. If you go to a piano and play the key on the far left, that's a note called 'A'. If you play every white piano key from left to right, the note names go: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,...and so on. So, with a note-names-only system, you'd have to specify which particular A you're wanting the person reading to play. This is already a thing, by the way. The 'octaves' the note names are in are numbered by their pitch from low to high. They're written A1, A2, etc. So if you're trying to write out the first line of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" using only note names, you'd get something like: G2 G2 D3 D3 E3 E3 D3 C3 C3 B3 B3 A3 A3 G2. We have another problem here. The D3 after the two E3s is supposed to last twice as long as the other notes. So we need to invent a system for informing the player to hold that note exactly twice as long. Another potential problem is, what if the player doesn't use a Roman alphabet? There are many great Russian, Asian and Arabic composers. How do I communicate with them? I'll stop here, but I could find a few more problems easily. The point is the letter-name system only works on a very limited and simple level. If you wanted to communicate anything more than a list of the notes played, you would have to start inventing more and more complex notations, which would eventually make the music as complicated to learn as the present system we already have. Written music is a picture of the sounds you're making. You can tell from looking at the score that there are places with high-pitched notes, or low-pitched notes. There are places where the notes are very long, or places with a run of very fast notes, and that's easy to see from the way the music appears on the page. Personally, I think it's beautiful. Think of it, how do you "write" a sound? More specifically, how can you tell a violinist to play this arpeggio at this exact speed, accenting the first note, slurring the last three notes, and bringing the volume and intensity down as the arpeggio progresses? Even harder, how do you tell a violinist to do that when the violinist lives on the other side of the planet from you, and was born three-hundred years in the future? Written music is a system which has evolved over hundreds of years and continues to evolve. (I'm currently rehearsing a score for a Broadway musical which has a few icons of eyeglasses in various places. The eyeglasses are a warning to pay particular attention to what's about to happen. You won't find the little 'eyeglasses' icon in Beethoven. It's a new thing and it works pretty good.) It's not a perfect system, but it works very, very well when you consider the complexity of what it's conveying. As a teacher, I get asked OP's question quite often. I blame the alphabet. The problem is, as a teacher, you have to get the student to play some notes, and you have to call the notes *something.* So you say, "Play this, we'll call this note 'A.' Now play this, we'll call it 'B.'" Pretty soon, the student has learned to play a bunch of notes and has memorized the names. The memorization part is easy because the student is already an expert at the alphabet. The hard part is getting the student to attach the sound he or she is making to the musical staff instead of the alphabet. Once the student has attached the letter 'A' to a physical motion on the instrument, it's incredibly hard to detach them from it. When, in fact, the letter-name of the sound you're making is the *least* important thing to know. The fact that OP has posted this question makes me think that he or she has gotten stuck in this trap. If so, you're not alone. I got 'unstuck' by two methods: 1. Take a piece of sheet music and read it while listening to a recording of it. Try to follow the notes with your finger as they play. This is a great way to understand the twists and turns a score throws at you; codas, repeats, and whatnot. Plus, you get to see what intense passages look like on the page, and what mellow passages look like. 2. I took the advice of a teacher who told me "Read, read, read! Every day. Get a piece of music, read through it, and throw it away. Then get another." This is one of the best pieces of musical advice I've ever gotten. It really works. The 'separation' from letter names to 'just playing' occurs when you no longer notice the notes any more. For a non-musical example, when you look at a restaurant menu and see 'Cheeseburger,' you don't think "Letter C, letter H--they combine to form a 'ch' sound--letter E,...etc." you just think "cheeseburger" and automatically understand not only how the word is spoken, but all of the meanings it conveys. This same, instant level of understanding *will* happen with music reading, if you read a lot of music, just as it took a lot of reading practice to understand 'cheeseburger.' Eventually, after enough practice, the little black dot on the staff will just be a sound that you make on your instrument. You won't give it any more thought than you do the 'ch' in 'cheeseburger.' Remembering its letter-name will be an extra step that has no bearing on the music. I'd write more, but now I'm hungry for a cheeseburger.
Women in ancient Greece had very few rights. In Athens, foreign women were able to own property, but the number of such women was very small. Athenian women did not own property and had virtually no participation in public life. They were not citizens and were part of their master's (father's or husband's) household. They married very young and had limits on education. Women in some other Greek states (Sparta for instance) had higher status, but not equality by any means. A few (possibly legendary) exceptions to these rules cannot be taken as evidence of general status of women, which was very low through out the classical period.
It's not a rash, a crap load of the capillaries in her face exploded from her blood pressure as she was pushing.
Not everyone instantly dies with a head shot. Famous recent example: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords took a bullet right through the head and out the other side. She lost brain tissue but luckily the bullet did not sever the most vital parts of the brain, the ones you can't live without or the ones that would cause her to bleed out instantly. She is alive and recovering well.
To really **ELI5**... Imagine your whole class wants to prevent the teacher from getting work done, so you band together to ruin his/her day. You have some different options: 1. Bang pots and pans and turn out the lights. 2. Hum music or play the kazoo while wearing a mask. 3. Babble nonsense streams of syllables and make silly faces. 4. Continually interrupt and try to talk over one-another. 5. You sit at your desk, politely say "excuse me, Teacher?" and raise your hand... But when called on you pretend nothing happened. If the teacher asks you a question, you start answering and then pretend to fall asleep. 6. You act normally, except you speak entirely in an unintelligibly thick accent. 7. You ask lots of understandable questions for answers you don't care about. If the teacher asks you a question, you give an answer which is understandable but useless, like: "It depends... On... the stuff." The exact numbers blur together, but as you go to higher numbers on the scale, it takes more time and effort from you... but it also becomes harder for the teacher to clearly identify (and unarguably punish) you for your disruption.
Let's say you want to make widgets, but you need money. You could ask out investors, but if every inventor had to talk to every investor it would be time consuming. So investors give their money to fund managers and the fund managers distribute the money to inventors (taking a cut off the profits from investments or charging or fees). Everything else is just increasingly more complicated ways of trading risk for money. It's not much different than a grocery store. If every person that needed did had to contact and trade with every farmer it'd be insane. The grocer doesn't make anything, but they take a cut for facilitating a trade (essentially).
Because it contains a vital port - Sevastopol. The Russians have to ask the Ukrainians for permission to use this port, they get a lease on it - they literally "rent" it. This wasn't difficult with a pro-Russian president in Ukraine, however the Russians are very worried now, because there's been an uprising in Ukraine, and the pro-Russian president was turfed out, they may lose their lease on this port If they lose the lease, they lose their power in the region. Putin is a very clever man, he knows that he can *push* a certain amount and there won't be any military repercussions - no one is going to risk a massive war - so in a way he's playing a game of bluff, he'll push forces into Crimea, take Sevastopol all for himself - it'll cost Russia money and international relations - but he obviously thinks that the gamble is worth it to control such a vital port He doesn't have any strong opposition at home (running in opposition is "difficult" in Russia) and he pretty much runs the media - so he can convince the Russians at home, and those in the Ukraine that he is merely trying to protect them - this is something a lot of them believe Try not to think of countries as friends, but more as businesses - this is a hostile take-over, internationally it's condemned, but to Putin, that naval port permanently in the hands of Russia is worth it
Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research is ethically and politically controversial because it involves the destruction of human embryos, since the embryonic stem cells, being so early in development, are able to differentiate into any type of cell unlike type-limited pluripotent stem cells in later stages of life. As a matter of religious faith and moral conviction, some people believe that “human life begins at conception” and that an embryo is therefore a person
You're looking at it from the male's perspective. The female perspective is that she wishes to find a mate who will settle down to help raise offspring, thereby increasing the survival rate. So it seems like there is absolutely an evolutionary advantage in "falling in love". The advantage is that the offspring has a higher chance for survival since there are two parents to take care of the child, instead of just one. So it is more advantageous for a man to "spread his seed", but it is severely disadvantageous for a woman to hook up with a guy and to have him leave her all alone to raise a child. So there is a bit of a tug-of-war effect happening. It would make sense that children who are raised from two parents have a much greater survival rate than children who are raised without a father.
Bernie Sanders participated in one of the earliest sit-in protests against segregation, and helped to desegregate schools. He attended the 1963 March on Washington and saw the "I have a dream" speech in person. He endorsed Jesse Jackson for president, twice. BUT, a few weeks ago he was at an event with Martin O'Malley (the other guy in the democratic race) that was interrupted by BlackLivesMatter protesters. O'Malley, in response to the protesters and shouting, and probably in a clumsy attempt to agree, said “Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter,” which many took to be a very condescending and mistaken understanding of the whole point of that phrase. Sanders was ... also there? He tried to say something about economic inequality but none of it seemed satisfying to the protesters and he left the stage. So, a lot of uninformed people started to see him as an "old white guy who doesn't get it", despite him having a better record on this than literally anyone in the race. EDIT: Also, Bill Clinton has an excellent record regarding minority issues and was admirably called "the first black president". Of course that was long before Obama, at a time when most people thought we wouldn't get a real black president in our lifetimes. Still, the Clintons are very popular in that regard, and so Hillary has a lot of support from black people.
You're assuming banks actually care about consumers. They don't. Banks make most of their money out of businesses - the charges involved in business banking, merchant accounts, etc. are far more profitable than the tiny fees paid by most consumers. Banks are open when their profitable customers are open - during business hours.
Cruz was born to American citizen parents (so their citizenship passes to their son), Schwarzenegger was born to Austrians (whose Austrian citizenship passed to their son).
Paying overtime past 40 hours a week is required by law, otherwise companies wouldn't do it. People died to get labor laws like this to be passed so don't take it lightly. Staff cost money to train and maintain. Secondary costs like training, benefit, uniforms, insurance, etc cost money and the company has likely done the math and determined that paying staff overtime is cheaper in the long run then hiring more staff. It's also possible they are just badly understaffed and have to pay overtime because they can't get/retain enough people.
You have a dollar bill and want to go buy candy in Switzerland. You change your dollar bill and get about one Swiss Franc, with which you can buy, say, ten pieces of Swiss candy. Yummy. Swiss kids can also come to the USA, change one Swiss Franc for one dollar, and buy ten pieces of American candy. All's fine and dandy. If the Swiss Franc were a stronger currency, Swiss kids could get *two* dollars in return for one Swiss Franc, so they could go buy *twenty* pieces of candy in the US (edit: they'd still get 10 pieces of candy in their own country)! Awesome, right?! How could this be a bad thing? Well, it's because *you* would only get half a Swiss Franc in return for your dollar, and so you could only buy five pieces of candy in Switzerland. So you'd probably go buy candy somewhere else. And the Swiss candy makers would be very sad, because nobody would want to buy their candy anymore.
For better security. Any information no matter how small could allow someone to game the system and brute force a login. Let me give you an example. Say that I really didn't like Joe Forman and I wanted to get into his facebook account but I don't know what his username is but I know a few email addresses he's used. Login: Jforman@. URL_1  bad username Login: Joe_f@. URL_0  bad username Login: Lvs2@airmail.net bad password Aha. So Instead of not knowing what was wrong, now I know that lvs2@airmail.net is the right login. Now I can use other tricks to log in. I can try some commonly guessed passwords. I can go to a black hat web site and see if anyone with that email address ever had a password stolen, and hope they use the same password on other sites. I could google Joe Forman or that email, find out their birthday, maybe the name of their pet, favorite color from some questionnaire they took 5 years ago in a public forum. And I can use some of these to do a password reset "What is your birthday? Your pets name?" etc. Basically brute forcing an account is infinitely easier if you are able to get any pieces of information. It goes from impossible to hard, and hard is just a matter of patience and research.
They're much more vague than you think. The brain naturally works in your own circumstances to make it seem reasonable because that's what you're expecting to find. Try reading horoscopes without looking at the sign it belongs to tomorrow, or try reading horoscopes from different publications on the same day for the same sign, you'll notice what's up quickly.
She reigns over us. We love it. Seriously though, they're useful for legal matters - rather than having a relatively inflexible constitution, in theory our laws come from God, to the Queen and are more malleable as the Queen puts a lot of trust in her judges and Law Lords. She gives "Royal Assent"* - a kind of seal of approval to any laws made by our leaders in Parliament or the House of Lords. Additionally, the Royal family are handy for tourism and international politics. They can often be useful diplomats or representatives. They have a lot of training in this field. Our military is loyal to the Crown, and not any individual political party. Our government is chosen by the monarch after an election. She will (only) choose what the people have voted for, but the government rules by her consent.* Some people think they cost us a lot of money, but some people say they are wrong, in that the Royal Family are able to either support themselves, or that they cost each tax-payer a maximum of 6 pence per year. Britain has a long heritage based around our Royal Families  &  almost all of our military or government is based around the Crown. It would probably cost us a great deal to re-order our society away from that, we wouldn't benefit a huge amount from doing it, and we would lose something that we feel makes us special in some ways. Otherwise we'd decapitate the lot of 'em. *but not really, because it's all made up.
I live in Germany, where Walmart spectacularly failed. The biggest issue seems to be that Walmart failed to understand how cultural differences come into play; among the problems that are blamed for Walmart's failure in Germany are: * overambitious expansionist plans that went ahead despite the fact that a German company had successfully fought off a hostile takeover bid, at a time when Walmart was still very small in Germany; * attempts to cut costs by threatening workers with redundancy if they didn't accept working practices that were borderline illegal in Germany; * being forced by a German court to comply with German law by publishing financial statements, which revealed that the company was far worse off than it had claimed; * annoying employees and customers alike by insisting on policies that work well in the US but which Germans find creepy, such as employing greeters, or making staff offer assistance to any customer that comes within range (Germans prefer to be left to shop on their own, and to approach staff if and when they need help). The mistake was to fail to understand that laws, expectations and cultural attitudes are very different in other countries, and that not complying with them can sink your business. That's not to say that Walmart is completely unsuccessful outside of the US. For example, Walmart owns Asda, which until just a couple of years ago was the UK's second largest supermarket chain.
It doesn't. If you're wondering why cement trucks rotate their drum it is to keep the contents well mixed. Continuous mixing helps delay setting by not allowing any one part to get drier than the whole mass. It will still harden eventually though no matter how much you mix it.
They did, but it was not noticed because the electronics of the time. A World War 2 aircraft radio operating at 48 volts/ 15 amps would be able to handle an extra amp of electricity with out harm. it is 5% overloaded meanwhile a modern radio with microcircuits operating at 0.0003 volts and 0.0001 amps would burn out with 1 amp added. it is 1,000% overloaded.
This is a somewhat subjective question as some people may interpret these things to mean something else but here's my humble take on it: The drummer did the soundtrack for the movie. His being put in there serves as source music (music the actors can here) and nonsource music (the score). As for Birdman and the telekinesis and flying - those are all part of Riggin's psyche. Birdman was an easy roll that he had a lot of success with but he has tried to forget in order to become a more "serious actor". It was a large part of who he was and forgetting that and the other life changes he's made (divorce, estranged daughter, etc.) are taking their toll on his mind.
In the olden days, we didn't have refrigerators or freezers. We had insulated iceboxes. The [ice man]( URL_0 ) would bring by a chunk of ice every day (see also: milk man, egg man, and mail man). The ice would be put in the top of icebox. The ice would melt and run down the inside walls, cooling what was placed there, and the water would collect in a drip tray at the bottom. If you put hot food in the icebox, it would melt the ice faster. All the ice would melt before the ice man came again and your food would spoil. So it was common practice to let the food cool to room temperature before putting it into the icebox. Early refrigerator/freezers weren't very efficient, taking a long time to cool down hot food and allowing other food to get warmer in the process, so the practice continued. With current refrigerator/freezer technology, there's no reason to wait for the food to cool. I mean, I wouldn't go straight from the oven to the freezer, but no need to wait for it to get anywhere near room temperature, either.
I'd love an answer to this one. I have this mutant white hair that suddenly sprouts out of the middle of my forehead about twice a year. I pluck it and am good for a while. The thing is, I never notice it until it's a good inch long, so I'm left wondering if I never noticed or if it just appeared like the OP. There's no other hair around it to get lost in.
Stability. The horizontal ropes will bend and cause a lot more sway in the net if you grab them. You can picture how a horizontal rope will bend to make a "smile" shape when you put your weight on it. The vertical rope will be put under tension and won't deform like this.
Bags of chips are not full of air, they are full of nitrogen (I think) or some other chemical mix that keeps things fresh and reduces moisture and bacterial growth. As soon as you open the bag this dissipates.

Nothing. Its a thin shield for their bigotry. There are three major ways the idea of anything else falls apart. 1 . There is no basis in scripture to prevent gay marriage. The bible actually calls for the execution of gays. But nobody's going to claim the gays still being alive violates their religion because they know how batshit that is. They just moved the goalpost. 2 . Religious freedom means *you* are free to practice *your* religion. This works for anybody. In any direction. The comedy answer is comparing it to a diet. "To say my marriage is against your religion is like saying my cookies are against your diet." But I like this West Wing quote better.  > TOBY  > The truth is, I don't, sir. At least not a good one. I was intimidated by  > your Catholicism.  > BARTLET  > Really?  > TOBY  > Yeah.  > BARTLET  > It's my Catholicism, Toby. It works for me.  > ABBEY  > And me.  > BARTLET  > And her. Did you break any laws?  > TOBY  > No, sir.  > BARTLET  > Then a blessing on your house, young man. Mazel tov. Its *his* Catholicism. It affects how he acts and thinks. But not somebody else. You get to practice your faith, but you don't get to demand other people obey the requirements of your religion. Religion is a personal choice. 3 . Marriage is two different things. There's the religious thing, in the church, with the priest, the ring, and the pretty dresses, and the hilariously large cake. You know, all the Hollywood stuff. And then there's the thing the government does. That's a filing fee, a couple of witnesses and a couple of signatures. Romantic it ain't. Legal it is. Every time you read something about gay marriage rulings in the news, and all the court decisions. They are talking about option two. That's the one you have a Right to. Its a government service. People opposed to it try to talk like they are the same thing in an attempt to make the issue about religion, or the government forcing a religion to do something. Its not. Gay people have a right to walk into a government office and apply for a Marriage license. That church down the street being a religious institution still has the right to refuse to let them have their party with the cake and things there. Government employees have another problem. The government is forbidden from having a religious opinion. So someone acting on behalf of the government is also forbidden from having a religious opinion *while on duty*. The Davis court rulings made that really clear, Kim Davis is not entitled to First Amendment protections (Just like you may speak your mind, you may not be forced to speak things that you do not believe) for speech arising from her duties as County Clerk. Government Officers actually lose a bunch of rights while on duty, because people are given a lot more protections than the Government gets, and the Government is straight up not allowed to do some things. This is the only part where Religion meets Law and there is a direct conflict, because a Government job requires them to do things, and Government isn't allowed to do or not do something for religious reasons, so a religious person has to choose between their religion and their job if they conflict. But that brings it right back to the personal choice.

"identity politics" are political idea or efforts to encourage political activities based on someone's membership in a particular "identity" group. The most common examples in the U.S. are race, religion, and gender. The term is most frequently used with a negative connotation -- the idea being that "identity politics" is a way of setting groups against each other and making it harder to talk about actual policy because every discussion becomes about whether you are betraying your "group." However, it can also be used in a neutral or positive sense, to describe political appeals based on problems uniquely faced or experienced by people in certain social contexts.
Let's make a distinction between "is different" and "looks different". A 1080p or 4k image on a 720p screen will BE different from a 720p image. By that I mean if we took every pixel and compared the color value of them while displaying the 1080p and the 720p, they would be different. This happens because a 720p screen can't display all the pixels from a 1080p image, so it resizes it into 720p. To figure out what colors to display for each pixel of the new image, it "averages out" the neighbour pixels of the big image. This process isn't perfect, you're taking several values and producing 1 value. There's loss of quality (comparing to the original 1080p). Now let's compare that to a native 720p photo. Let's imagine you took the exact same photo in 720p and 1080p. Your screen displays the 720p natively, but resizes the 1080p. In order to BE the same, the average-out process would need to produce the exact same 720p image (as in, every pixel having the same color value) as the original 720p photo. This can happen, but it's unlikely. It depends on too many factors (if the camera is the same, it also averaged-out when taking the 720p, for example). Now about LOOKING different. In my opinion, it can look better. The difference isn't usually that obvious, but 2 factors make it somewhat better to watch for example 4k on a 1080p screen. If you have a 1080p camera and take a 1080p photo, it has 1 sensor-thingy determine what color should be attributed to 1 pixel. But if you use a 4k camera to take a 1080p shot, or you take a 4k shot and resize it to 1080p, you have 4 pixels to figure out what the color for the new pixel should be. It should look closer to the natural thing. I have several 4k wallpapers that look better on my 1080p screen that 1080p wallpapers. The other factor is that it makes sense that cameras with higher resolutions will also have better overall quality. Although it's possible that a manufacturer produces a 20 megapixel camera and cuts corners on the aperture, for example. Or for example people who own and use 20 megapixel cameras are in general more knowledgeable about photography than people with 1080p cameras. This has nothing to do with the resizing or the screen, of course.
You're probably only ever seeing footage of Prime Minister's Questions, which is half an hour each week. This is essentially all for the benefit of the TV cameras, with the party leaders trying to score points against each other with witty soundbites. Questions from other MPs tend to be chosen to win favour with your party leader - praising or criticising some government policy as appropriate - or to show that they're raising some local issue with the PM. The actual debates the rest of the time are much more formal and dull.

Interestingly enough, Randall Monroe, the author of XKCD, a wonderful webcomic, has addressed this very question, and in a very approachable way. One which is, in fact, long enough to not run afoul of the auto-nazi modbot.  URL_0  The short answer is "not much, just some turbulent warm water which doesn't even make it to the surface."
Truth be told, pi isn't big at all. Pi is approximately 3 (3,141592...), it's just impossible to display exactly. Any approximation you make, will necessarily be off by a little bit. So, let's see. Let's fill the circle with a square size 2. Then we've still got 4 parts left, so let's try and fill those up with squares. As you may be able to see, this will never fill up. A similar thing happens to pi, no matter how many digits you list, you never "fill up" the number.
Because that is not true. I'm assuming this is about that ridiculous poster that made its rounds in /r/pics. Regardless though, it isn't even true that being drunk means you are unable to consent (it is only at a certain level of drunkness that comes into play) and the law governing that is written completely gender neutral. Women don't have an up on men in this case. [This] ( URL_0 ) comment has some good explanation of the laws in this case.
Imagine the coal coating the inside of an uncleaned chimney is on fire and you're standing on the roof. Pouring water down the chimney to drown the fire would miss a lot of the fire on the way down. So you'd have pour enough water to flood the entire house and let the rising water put out the fire in the chimney. However the house has its windows open. So the water going into that cavern could end up in a neighboring cavern.
**Because you are not conscious.** How did you feel before you were born? What was the passage of time like before you were conceived? The exact same phenomena will occur to you after your death.
a lock out is the opposite of a strike, the owners are not letting the employees work until a new contract is negotiated. The contract between players and owners expired this year. Players and owners needed to make a new contract that would establish how they split up the money they earn(Profit/Revenue). Owners don't want to give up more than 47% of the money that the NBA as a whole earns. Players want 50%. Players do not want a hard cap on salary, meaning that teams have a set maximum for total salary to all players on the roster. The owners want to reduce the minimum salary. Owners are also complaining about the economic conditions of small-market teams such as (Toronto, The Pacers, The Bucks) versus large market teams (Heat, Boston, Lakers). The major source of contention is splitting the Profit, the latest deal offered by owners was 49% of the money with a hard salary cap. Players did not like this deal and felt that the union, who is negotiating the deal on their behalf, was not doing a good enough job on their behalf, they want to leave the union (de-certify) and go to court for an anti-trust lawsuit. anti-trust being laws that are suppose to prevent monopolies, which the NBA has on professional basketball in the US.
It's not just about the orgasm. The sex thought process is also driven by the biological need to procreate and produce the next generation. Women are fertile a few days of the month, but men are fertile pretty much all the time, and a guy can fertilize many many women. So biologically men's sex drive is higher and they think of it more often. And yes, there are lots and lots of individual exceptions. This is from a general trend perspective.
The extra soil room does not harm most plants at all. It does make them a little harder to water and to fertilize.
VR headsets have to render two images at very high framerates. To accomplish that without hugely expensive hardware the game developers have had to tone down the resolution and visual effects.

SCIENTIST HERE. Let me explain. We have been measuring how much energy the sun puts out for the last 45 years (with satellites). So we know how much the sun contributes to global warming. We also know how much greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Why? Because there is a law of physics known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law. If you plug the energy of the sun hitting Earth into that equation, and take into consideration the geometry of the Earth, you get an answer that says the temperature of Earth should be about 10 degrees Celsius or more colder than it actually is. So the greenhouse effect makes Earth at least 10 degrees warmer (that is a global average). Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be an iceball. That gives you an idea of how potent the greenhouse effect is. What drives the greenhouse effect? Well, most of the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor in the atmosphere. The next most important molecule is carbon dioxide. Some global warming deniers point to the water vapor fact mentioned above as evidence that global warming is a natural cycle. There is a major problem with that: water vapor is a "feedback" not a "forcing." What do I mean by that? If you were to "force" vast amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere, it would just turn into rain. That water vapor would not stick around for long. Why? Because water vapor rises in the atmosphere. It is cold in the upper atmosphere, and rain is generated when there is a) enough cold, and b) enough water vapor in the atmosphere. This is why we consider water vapor a "feedback." It "feeds" upon the temperature of the planet. In other words, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is controlled by how hot the atmosphere and oceans are. If they are hot, there is more water vapor. If they are cold, there is less water vapor. There is nothing we can do about that. Water vapor simply AMPLIFIES the greenhouse effect. So to explain the greenhouse effect, we are left looking at other molecules. Like I said earlier, CO2 is the next most IMPORTANT greenhouse gas on Earth (i.e. the next biggest contributor). There are more POTENT greenhouse gases, such as SF6 and methane, but they occur in trace amounts compared to CO2. CO2 makes up more than 400 parts per million (ppm) of the atmosphere. That means that for every million molecules in the atmosphere, 400 of them are CO2. That doesn't sound like much, but it has a large effect. You see, water vapor absorbs different wavelengths of light than CO2 does. CO2 "fills in the gaps" that water vapor leaves behind. This means that MUCH MORE sunlight and heat is trapped on Earth's surface, making Earth hotter on average. Many, many different climate models show that CO2 is the primary driver of climate change today. We know exactly how much CO2 levels have increased since satellites were invented. We know exactly how much the Sun's energy has fluctuated over that time period - it has not increased; if anything it has decreased slightly. In short, there is no other way to explain global warming since the beginning of the satellite era than by CO2 levels increasing. Scientists can look back farther in the past. We have instrumental records going back to the Industrial Revolution. Even though our instruments were not as sophisticated back then, they are enough to demonstrate that CO2 has been the major driver of climate change since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Looking back even farther, into ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland, we see a close relationship between CO2 and temperature. The same is true when we look back millions of years and even billions of years. CO2, more than any other factor, seems to be the major driver of climate change over Earth's history. Some other important factors include large scale volcanism and plate tectonics, but plate tectonics happens too slowly to matter over a 100 year timescale and there is no evidence that volcanic activity has increased over the last 100 years. Furthermore, explosive volcanism causes cooling in the short term: volcanic ash is injected into the atmosphere, and this ash reflects sunlight back. So this brings us back to the question: HOW do we know that mankind is responsible for CO2 increases since the Industrial Revolution. Well, there are many reasons. First, it is simply common sense. Combustion of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, etc.) releases vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Furthermore, CO2 produced by human activity has a unique isotopic signature. Some climate change deniers say that volcanoes could be responsible for CO2 rise over the last century. This is patently false. Across the world, volcanoes put out one-tenthousandth the amount of CO2 as humans do. Volcanic CO2 has a different isotopic composition than CO2 from fossil fuels. All the evidence points to the fact that CO2 rise since the Industrial Revolution is due almost SOLELY to human activity. Finally, one issue that climate deniers frequently bring up is the issue of "heat islands" - that is, that some temperature stations are installed in urban areas that are warmer than their surroundings. This heat island effect is well-known by climate scientists, and is corrected for. The only rebuttal to this is to claim that the entire climate science community is part of a highly organized scam. If you know scientists personally, you know pulling something like that off is like herding cats. It just doesn't happen. On a final note, I will say that the satellite record of temperature change, sun activity and CO2 levels is outstandingly remarkable. That record alone demonstrates that global warming over the past ~40 years has been due ENTIRELY to human beings. If you extrapolate back, that statement appears to apply to the entire 20th century. Indeed, it seems to apply to human history dating back to the Industrial Revolution... and perhaps even further. In short, climate change deniers do not have evidence on their side. They are extremely dishonest, and most of them appear to be deniers because it gets them attention. If you pay attention to the news, the same dozen or so climate deniers are interviewed. That is how small the climate change denier community is among qualified experts. Sure, there are dentists who have signed petitions saying that they do not believe in human-caused global warming, BUT WHAT THE HELL DO DENTISTS KNOW ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.
There are a few reasons. The primary is research. It gives us a chance to explore a body that we've never been able to study in depth before. Looking at samples of the asteroid may offer insight into it's creation, and the creation of the solar system in general. The second reason, is what I believe to be more of a "proof of concept". The asteroid selected is nearby and convenient to access, but a successful capture opens the door to retrieving more distant (and more valuable) asteroids. Many asteroids contain metals that are rare and precious on Earth. There are several platinum rich asteroids that have been discovered, and others have been observed to be rich in other heavy-metals. Successful mining would lead the way to a very lucrative (and beneficial) industry. And the first step towards mining these asteroids is capturing them.
Because FM is a newer and better technology: Imagine the radio waves are light. AM transmits by changing the brightness of a light (Amplitude Modulation), FM transmits by changing the colour of the light (Frequency Modulation). If you have a clear view of both lights then they both sound good, but imagine if you're driving and trees get in the way of the light beam. You can still see the light through the leaves, but not as well. With AM the brightness of the light keeps changing as leaves block it so the volume keeps going up and down. With FM it doesn't matter how bright the light is because you only care about the colour, which doesn't change. The reason you still have AM as well as FM because AM is much cheaper to broadcast and the signals travel further.
Historically, fat was meant for emergencies only. A last-ditch reserve to maintain life when food is scarce. The hunger motivates you to eat so you don't have to dip into this emergency reserve. The dizziness is because you take as little energy out of your reserves as is needed to maintain life. Having low energy makes you feel dizzy and faint. Your body doesn't know whether you're going a few hours without food or a few days, so it plans on the worst case scenario.
Real world example. I am a manager for a $4 million a year store in a multi billion dollar company. My company pays 50 cents above minimum wage as a starting point. In Ontario Canada, recently our minimum wage went up to 11.25, therefore we pay 11.75. My wage budget for the year did not change with this increase in wage that all of my minimum wage workers received. If I am spending an extra $2 per standard closing shift, per employee, over the course of the year, the only thing I can do is not book as many people, or throw my wage out of whack. Essentially, your time as an employee for me is worth more, but as a result I will see you less, meaning over the course of a year, you will earn less. My expectations when I do see you is that you juggle more customers and/or tasks. Higher stress for the employee over their 4 hour shift for $2. Now the other problem is my full timers used to earn $2 plus an hour more then new kids because of there experience and skill set. That differential is eroded because those earning above minimum didn't see an equivalent increase. Up one more peg, my entry level managers make around $15 an hour on salary. If I increase wages for my full time floor staff, then I am showing them I value them above part timers, but I bring them dangerously close to my management team. If I increase full time and management wage 50 cents, which is 8 bodies, then that's $160 week more on wage. There goes another 4 shifts a week for part timers. The end result ends up being either 1) low skilled or low experienced employees making more while the rest of our tenured staff, management included continue on. 2) a wonderful trickle up effect where we all make more money. 3) I increase my valued employees wage to keep pace and shrink my roster down. Whatever anyone says about the ramifications, there are good and bad points for increasing. The bottom line is if 50 cents can throw of my wage for the couple months I have left of fiscal, you can be guaranteed that a jump up to $15 or anything like that will have drastic changes, if not to the requirements to receive the job, then to the expectations placed on individuals in that job. Tl;dr I have 3 apples for 3 people, but each person is now entitled to 1 and a half apples. I'm gonna need less people
Because wages are also a signaling mechanism. If you operate a business, you've got employees at all levels and you pay those employees enough to keep them happy enough that they don't leave. That means what you pay them is strongly related to their expectations. People expect to be paid around the industry standard for their profession. They expect to be paid in accordance to their years of service/experience. They expect to be paid based on their level in the company. They also expect to be paid more than they were in the past. If you violate these expectations, you'll end up with workers leaving - even if their pay is competitive in the market. So let's say you've got a line of widget wranglers. You pay all of them $10/hour. Unemployment drops and you simply can't find new widget wranglers to replace the ones who retire or drop out of the workforce at $10/hour. So you offer $12/hour to new hires. How do you think that makes your existing employees feel once they find out? Probably pretty angry. So before you can offer $12/hour to new widget wranglers, you've got to give all your *old* widget wranglers $12/hour. Which means giving a raise to all their supervisor so they're not being paid less than their subordinates - which means giving a raise to all *their* supervisors, etc. Now you've give a company-wide raise to everyone just so you can hire a few widget-wranglers. Suddenly a recession occurs. Now you've got a massive payroll you can't afford. But you can't simply cut wages - your employees would feel insulted and leave. So you're losing money hand over foot simply because you needed a very junior level of employee. The alternative? You could have simply not hired that extra widget wrangler at $12/hour and waited it out until you found someone willing to accept $10/hour. The latter strategy is almost always the more sensible one.
Efficiency, for one. Flywheels are used in a few applications, like very large online UPSes (uninterruptable power supplies). High speed flywheels can make a big mess and kill if they come apart, so some work is being done to find good designs that can run at very high RPMs. This helps make them more efficient and higher capacity, while making them smaller in size. EDIT: typos EDIT 2: and size. Size could be the biggest reason.
 URL_0  ELI5 answer: each of the Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland) formed their own soccer leagues before FIFA formed. When FIFA was created, they let The United Kingdom keep their own separate leagues. After the split between The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, The North made a new league so they could keep playing soccer. The IOC forces all countries to play as one team, so they will not allow countries like Great Britain to break up into the four Home Nations. Dependent territories gets a little trickier.
Growling in dogs isn't a show of aggression. It is a show of unease - you're invading its space or you represent a threat and (s)he wants you to back off. It's actually a sign the dog would prefer for this to not evolve into conflict. Aggressive dogs attack without any growling.
There was a time when the year began in the month containing the beginning of Spring, namely March. This meant that February was the last month of the year, and it originally had 30 days. July and August were renamed for Caesars of Rome and at the time those months were only 30 days. To honor the greatness of the Caesars, those months were extended to 31 days each and the days were taken from the end of the year, which at the time was February.
Most dialogue in movies, unless its recorded on a sound stage, is dubbed later in a process known as Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR).

Because (1) sex is awesomely fun, but (2) sex is *really, really complicated*, while (3) sex can have significant and permanent consequences (like babies), so (4) a lot of people think that *something* ethical or at least important is going on when you have sex. As a result, it's something that most people intuitively feel should be given *some* kind of special treatment, even if there are differences of opinion as to what that looks like. It's not strictly a religion issue either. There are plenty of people who aren't religious who consider it to be basically a private matter.
When drugs are illegal, addicts are criminals, so they're obviously afraid to go seek help from authorities. Addicts who don't get help find it a lot harder to quit.
The Judicial branch is not elected. It is non-party affiliated. That is the primary check against what you are describing.
When you have air under water, the water molecules would rather be next to other water molecules rather than air molecules. By forming a bubble, the air molecules are able to form a shape which minimizes the amount of air which is next to a water molecule. Another way to think about it: Imagine a giant field packed with 100,000 Boston Red Sox fans and 10,000 Yankee fans. The Yankee fans are greatly outnumbered and dispersed in a crowd of Red Sox Fans. Given that a Yankee fan would much rather be next to another Yankee fan than a Red Sox fan, we can imagine that any Yankee fan would look around and try to walk towards the nearest group of Yankee fans so that they could cheer together. Once there were enough Yankee fans in one area, they would form into a circle, so that only the Yankee fans on the outside had to be next to Red Sox fans, and the rest of them could be surrounded by other Yankee fans. If you want to go even deeper, the Yankee fans could move towards the edge of the field if they were close enough to see it, so that only one side of them had to be next to the Red Sox fans, as they would rather stand next to a wall than next to a Red Sox fan. Then they would form a semi-circle. This same phenomenon describes why you get bubbles forming on the edge of a glass more often than you get them in the center.
Precisely because plane crashes happen so rarely compared to car crashes is why you hear about them on the news. A traffic accident is quite literally an everyday experience, so no one cares. A plane crash happens only once in a blue moon, so that's news.
Its actually a really big question in biology right now and no one knows for sure why we do it. My personal favorite theory is that its nature telling us to sit down and shut up when we're least able to defend ourselves. Imagine a small tribe of humans is existing on the African Savannah. Night rolls around and humans cant see shit. Lions have much better night vision than humans. So its in our best interest to avoid the lion in any way possible If we're quiet and still we dont attract as much attention. Ergo, less likely to be eaten by lions
My wife asks me why i own a "fast" car all the time even though I (almost) never speed. For me more power and torque is still really fun to go from zero to speed limit quickly. Also on ramps and merging are fun with more power. Plus some people have local dragstrips or trackdays they can use the car on but I suspect that is a small amount of the population.
Giving this my best shot: The hair colouring is decided by the chemical structures that make it up. Depending on the ratios of two chemicals (eumelanin and pheomelanin) hair colours range from black through brown, red, and into white. There just isn't a colour in there for green and there isn't much of a selective pressure to have such a colour in mammals. The colours we have are good enough.

In my university at least, the material is widely complemented with the professor's personal experience in the field. A school like Harvard probably attracts professors with more renown across their field for the things they've done than a local college with professors who might not have experienced as much as the Harvard guy. This doesn't mean that any one school is automatically better than all others, but no school is exactly the same because of this. You might take a class at one University and the professor has absolutely no idea what they're talking about and just reading off slides that aren't even theirs. You can take the same class at another school, with the same curriculum, but with a professor that shares more insight into how things actually work in the real world.
Pirate Bay did not take a prudent step to protect themselves. That is the issue. Most times a hosting site cannot be charged for distributing copyrighted or illegal material, because as you say, it is the users who are doing that. However, if illegal activity is brought to the attention of the hosting site and they do nothing about it, it can be argued that they are knowingly and willingly allowing it to happen. We can use reddit for an example. When the leaked celebrity photos happen, they banned the subreddit that was posting them. They were made aware of the sharing of illegal activity and they took a prudent step to prevent it. This does not mean reddit has to actively search their site for illegal content, but they cannot just ignore it when it is brought to their attention.

The eye doesn't do the seeing. The eye is just the thing that takes in light, bounces it off the optic nerve, and sends that message to the brain. The brain is what does the seeing. It takes in the electrical impulse and translates that into what you understand as a visual image. Unless it is asleep. Then it isn't taking in impulses, it is sleeping. No impulse, no image.
**preamble**: as a physicist, I'm sorry to see that ELI5 has so many wrong answers. [OccularHedonist (8 points as I type) says]( URL_0 ) "The heat is held down at lower levels because the atmosphere holds it in like a blanket", which is sort of correct -- but the holding down happens in the stratosphere, which is higher than any mountain (and therefore doesn't answer the question), and/or is regional rather than based on altitude. ~~[potterarchy (6 points as I type)]( URL_2 ) says that it's greenhouse gases, which is basically the same wrong answer, rephrased.~~ [Florinandrei (5 points as I type)]( URL_1 ) says that it's distance from the heat reservoir of the Earth, which isn't really the answer either. *If you want real answers to questions like this, you are probably better off at /r/askscience, which is more heavily moderated and more heavily frequented by people who actually know the answer to your question*. Here at ELI5 you are likely to get the same kind of easily-memorable but wrong answer that your dad gave you when you were 5. **answer**: The air gets colder as you go up because the lower atmosphere is mixed up by up-and-down winds, which I'll explain in a moment. Air that moves up expands and cools off as it goes up, because all gases cool off as they expand. Air that moves down gets compressed and heats up from the compression. You can notice that kind of cooling if you spray a whole bunch of paint out of one of your dad's cans of spray paint -- the can will get cold from the expansion. You can notice that kind of heating if you pump up a bike tire. The nozzle of the air pump will get hot from the compression. Up and down motions of the air carry a tremendous amount of heat up and down in the part of the atmosphere where we live, and mix it all up. That makes the air at every height above sea level the same temperature as it would be if it just came up from sea level very fast, so up high the air is colder because it just expanded more. That lowest part of the atmosphere is called the "troposphere" (pronounced like "trope oh sphere"). The reason the troposphere mixes up heat is that air in these bottom, dense layers of the atmosphere is heated by the sunlit ground. Air right near the ground gets warm, then expands and rises (like a hot air balloon, without the balloon). As it rises, it cools off -- but it's still warmer than the cooler air around it, so it carries on rising for a long time -- up to about 20,000 or 30,000 feet above the ground(!) Eventually, that little parcel of air does cool off by radiating heat (like a warm rock cools off if you put it in the shade), and then it sinks all the way back down to the ground again to get some more heat. All of the air in the troposphere does that more or less all the time. That's why airplane rides are bumpy on approach to the airport, particularly on sunny days -- you end up flying through the up and down currents in the air.
Essentially, they're saying that competition for wages in *Mexico* will increase because of the influx of skilled workers. That is, the people gained skill in the US, and are now returning to Mexico as skilled workers--which (ironically enough) ends up meaning they're taking Mexican jobs away from Mexicans who have been there for years or decades. Since there will be an increase in skilled labor, that means there will be a corresponding increase in competition for jobs, which means wages will be driven down.  > Is there someone who can explain to me economically whether undocumented immigrants are good or bad for the wages of American construction workers? It could be good or it could be bad. It's a loss of talent, which means that jobs will open up. Depending on the labor pool in the area, that could cause a feeding-frenzy of job searching that drops wages down, or it could cause a higher demand (from employers) than supply (from employees) that would drive wages up. My *personal opinion* is that the slow removal of illegal immigrants from the system (note: *slow.*) is a good thing, economically. A very fast removal would be a bad thing because it would totally upset the economy. None of that opinion even touches on whether it's a good *social policy.* EDIT: Fixed spelling mistake.

Limiting access to emergency stairwells should ensure that they are in the proper condition to be used in an emergency. There is often a concern in places like a university or a hospital that people will congregate in stairwells. Either to do something they are not supposed to do, or for whatever reason people seem to love stairs. Seldom used stairwells can become a prime place for storing old furniture or other equipment that makes evacuation hazardous when there is a real emergency. Additionally, many emergency fire doors lead to parts of a building that are not designed for regular access. (I am looking at a fire door that leads to a creepy underground tunnel which terminates in an alley two blocks from the building. I would not want random people walking through that door thinking they are going directly out to the street and then getting lost in the emergency egress tunnel.) Underlying your question is another question, why do buildings need so many otherwise useless fire exits? Large institutional fires are horrific, and the death toll often results from lack of access to means of egress. If you have a fire in your building, you want as few wrongful death lawsuits as possible, the easiest way to save people (other than not having any fires, which is attempted though less obvious then fire doors), is having lots of visible means of safe exit. Lastly, the more I see a fire exit that I can't use, the more I think about it and hopefully in a fire I would rush towards that fire door that I never use but always think about rather then the overflowing regular exit.
The people making it can't even figure out how to get a roughly 15 foot area of sidewalk panels to light up, let alone produce energy, and that's after several million dollars, and YEARS of work. The entire designed is flawed, as they are too fragile, would never be able to reach 100 capacity (solar panels need to be angled towards the sun, road needs to be flat). Plus, glass is a HORRIBLE road surface. Aside from the fragility issue, the second it rains, you'd might as well be driving on ice it's be so slippery. Oh, and it's also completely cost ineffective.
I only have my own answer to this, but going to give it anyway. I'm not sure we perceive time at all. Time is just the word we use to say one thing happens after another. We can make machines that make one thing happen after another at a regular rate, call it a clock, and measure stuff with it, but can we talk about a perception of time? If so it would be relative to or own appreciation, in context, at the time. So in that sense a pigeon, metabolic rate 160 times faster than ours, probably understands things at a different speed, but perceive time? time isn't something you touch, manipulate or even experience. It's just an arbitrary measurement for purposes of synchronization.
Although prehistoric humans are often called "cavemen" its likely that the vast majority of early humans did not live in caves. Caves are where we find most prehistoric human artifacts, but that's because caves preserve things that would be destroyed, lost, or buried outside. It's far more likely that most humans lived in things like tents and huts. Keep in mind that prehistoric humans had the same intelligence as you or I, and so were perfectly capable of constructing simple shelters. Also, you assume that fears like claustrophobia are hereditary. That's far from clear.
Intervene how? We're already funding anti-drug efforts, sending agents down, providing weapons and training, etc. The problem is that the cartels have tens of billions of dollars a year, and a ready supply of weapons being smuggled across the border. (Not small guns; heavier munitions that the US makes in its war industries.) They've been able to use these arms to stage increasingly violent conflicts with the military - having already bought off most of the police departments with drug money (or installed corrupt officials). There is a growing sentiment in Mexico that the US is causing this problem for them by funding the cartels with its domestic drug policy, and so invading Mexico in response to the cartels would be a great way to ensure the general Mexican populace dislikes us, too. tl;dr: The Mexican deaths are the casualties in the US's "War on Drugs", and invading them would make it even more obvious it was our unilateral policy choices getting them killed, and make us even less popular. Edit: To understand the scale of the problem, since 2006, somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 Mexicans have died in the current bout of drug violence. Understandably, the Mexican people are unhappy that thousands of murders are being committed each year because of US drug policy.
You don't have to own or drive a car. If you choose to do so, one of the responsibilities is to get liability insurance. I don't have to live in a certain apartment or rent a certain home but some may say that if I want to live here, I need renter's insurance. Basically you can opt-out of having to buy the insurance by not doing those activities. You have a choice. Mandatory health insurance though, simply by existing you need to have health insurance. Other than dying, not living in the country, or paying a fine, there is no method to opt-out
We used the Gregorian calendar which was influenced by the Roman Empire and the Julian calendar. The Julian calendar had January 1st and the beginning of the new year because that is when consuls, a type of politician, took office for Rome.
**Not everyone can be or is vaccinated** So, say you have a 4 month old child. That child is not inoculated against measles, because you don't get that vaccine until 12 months. However, that child can still get the measles. Similarly, say you have a kid who has been otherwise sickly, or is one of the rare, but not unheard of kids for whom the vaccine doesn't take. Or say you're an old person whose immune system has simply weakened overall. In any of these cases, the unvaccinated child is a danger.
Same way you can take a picture of your house while standing inside your house. Of course, what you can photograph of your house while you are inside your house is rather limited. In the same way, what you can photograph of the Milky Way while inside the Milky Way is also limited, but at least the "walls" are largely transparent, so you can see much more than one room. Continue the analogy with a transparent city: you can see the bathroom, you can see the garage, you can see the kitchen (but your view is obscured by the fireplace and the furnace and the water heater), you can also see into and *through* the neighbors' houses (but not through their fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters), you can see way up and down and *through* the block (except through fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters), you can see all over and *through* the city (except for fireplaces, furnaces, water heaters, sewers, water and power systems). Much is obscured, but much more is transparent. And different parts of the city are transparent to different kinds of light, so what you can't see because of all the water heaters in visible light you might see in, say, ultraviolet light. Plot the positions of all these details carefully, and you could still come up with a pretty good map of your city. Likewise, we can come up with a pretty good map of the Milky Way.
It's not a "stretch" but more of a "relax". The sphincter muscles there are only partly under conscious control for regular people, but it happens that the act of bearing down and pushing out to poop cues them to literally let go for a moment. Also, not everyone's going to enjoy the sensation of being penetrated there, and use of a lot of good lube is super important.
The percentage rate thing basically comes down to perceived consumer control. A flat rate, or more radically, paying servers a living wage and charging no service fee, removes [perceived] control from the consumer over how their restaurant experience goes. Jay Porter, a California restauranteur, transitioned his restaurant from a traditional tip system to a No-tip, flat service fee back in 2006, and wrote a [series of blogs]( URL_0 ) describing the experience back in 2013. They're a decent read and a worth a look if you're more interested in the subject, but the long and short of his experience is that people didn't like not being able to punish/reward their servers. He expands that the majority of complaints he got at the restaurant were from men who were upset they couldn't give generous tips to cute female waitresses. I say *perceived* control above, because (and this is only somewhat related the question posted) the idea that "servers work harder for good tips" is covered in Porter's blog and as anyone who's worked in a restaurant knows, is pretty much bunk. Servers get paid more when they work more tables, period. In general, customers tip the same no matter what kind of service they got, extreme cases of bad/good service notwithstanding. And since many restaurants pool tips among servers (and often distribute portions to cooks and bus staff as well) each individual server's performance has very little to do with how much that server takes home at the end of the night.
Silver is not as resistant to corrosion and it "tarnishes" - the corroded material/tarnish are not as conductive. Gold is remarkable in that it does not tarnish and does not corrode under most circumstances.
Previously worked at a car dealership and still work in the automotive industry and currently lease a vehicle. There is a lot of wrong comments in this thread. Let me give you some clarification. - Whether you Lease or Purchase a vehicle unless you write a check for the car the bank OWNS the car. Not You. - Leasing is another way to finance the vehicle where you are paying a little extra to remove yourself from liability of the cars equity. - You can still negotiate and sell the vehicle at any point while on a lease contract, you don't just have to turn the vehicle in at the end. If you have equity you can use it as a negotiation tool when you trade for another vehicle. - when you turn a vehicle in it's the banks vehicle not the dealership, usually the bank will offer it to the dealership first but you can turn it into any dealership any of them can negotiate. This means the dealership doesn't necessarily care whether you lease or buy. That being said... - manufacturers want people leasing because it is more likely you will want a new car In a few years even tho you have the option of buying the vehicle first at the end of your lease and refinancing it. - dealers want you to lease because it is a lot easier for a dealership to add profit places. they can fudge the Cap cost, they can fudge the residual value, this is where it's an afvantage for a dealer to have you lease. It has to do with the contracts, it's easier to hide money in a lease contract. TLDR: Just to wrap up because I think I'm writing a lot. Lease is just another way to finance. Any way you finance you don't own the car. If you are going to Lease do lots of research go to more places and look closely at your contract. If you have any questions just ask, I love helping people buy cars because after selling them I know there are a lot of ways you don't know where I can still make money.
Its a different market approach. Cable (and HBO) subscribers are used to the typical "one a week" format so that is how the shows are released Netflix users are more "binge" watchers, so they release everything at once to satisfy them.
Having a mental disorder does not mean that your brain is different. Wikipedia: "A mental disorder, also called a mental illness[2] or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life. Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as a single episode. Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders" I imagine pedofilia is considered as such because fulfilling such desires is violent and extremely harmful to a childs psyche. Pedofilia is after all always non consensual, since the target is by definition a person too immature to be able to give consent.
In a sense you aren't. There is a position in society for criminals, often imprisoned or at the least exiled from most civilized society or living as an underclass. Living in that fashion you would not have to abide by a nation's rules but you also would not likely have access to the benefits of that society. In a sense citizenship and being the member of a nation IS voluntary but the majority accept it to avoid conflict with power structures and to access it's privileges.
Iraq invaded Kuwait for financial reasons mostly. Kuwait supported Iraq during the war with Iran. After the war Iraq was in debt to Kuwait for something like $15 billion. Kuwait refused to debt relief. Kuwait was over prducing oil when there was already a glut. This drives the price of oil down which is bad for Iraq because they are really far in debt not just to Kuwait but to many countries around the world to the tune of $60 billion. Also Iraq accused kuwait of slant drill across the border into Iraq and pumping oil from Iraqi oil fields. Now, how does Iraq invade Kuwait and not expect retaliation from the U.S. and other? Iraq at the time was the most powerful military in the region and the U.S. and Russian had just wound down the cold war. Iraq calculated we wouldn't be able to stomach another conflict with Vietnam and Afghanistan in our rearview mirror. Another reason they thought the U.S. wouldn't get involved was a matter of mixed signals from the U.S. ambassador. Statements such as " we have no opinion on Arab-Arab conflicts" and that the U.S. did not intend to "start an economic war against Iraq". This was said while Iraqi forces were forming on the border with Kuwait. These statements and others, said and not said, was seen as a go ahead for invasion. The U.S. didn't think Iraq was really going to annex Kuwait. The U.S. believed it was just posturing by the Iraqis to put pressure on Kuwait for debt relief and lower oil prduction. I've heard that Saddam was surprised by the response from the U.S.
I think they, the courts, view it as handing out the maximum sentence. Aka not going easy on them and dropping charges. They are well within the law so it's not cruel or unusual.
Your body feels the transfer of heat not really temperature. Diarrhea is mostly water and water has a high convection coefficient, meaning it transfers heat faster. Think of it the same effect as biting into a really hot pizza, the cheese burns you more than the crust. They're both at the same temperature but cheese transfers heat faster. Also, water has high heat capacity, so for every degree of temperature, it has a lot more heat. Regular feces doesn't have as much water in it so it doesn't transfer as much heat as quickly, that's why diarrhea feels hotter. Really, no matter what comes out of you, it's at body temperature. **TL;DR: Diarrhea is the same temperature as regular feces 98.6F/37C but it transfers heat quicker because it's mostly water so it feels hotter.** Edit: for clarity. Edit2: Everyone keeps mentioning acidic diarrhea causing this sensation. What I describe above is why it feels *hotter* not *burning*. The burning feeling is from digestive enzymes, though completely different and distinct when compared to the warmer feeling of shooting liquid out your behind. Also, one thing I neglected to mention, mostly for simplicity, is that it's not just the convection coefficient of water that helps the transfer of heat happen quicker but also the fact that it is liquid vs solid. Liquids cover more surface area, therefore can transfer that heat quicker.
This doesn't address the philosophical perception of beauty, but primates' ability to see them in three colors is special, in the world of mammals:  > Today, most mammals possess dichromatic vision, corresponding to protanopia red–green color blindness. They can thus see violet, blue, green and yellow light, but cannot see ultraviolet, and deep red light.[4][5] This was probably a feature of the first mammalian ancestors, which were likely small, nocturnal, and burrowing. ...  > Primates have re-developed trichromatic color vision since that time, by the mechanism of gene duplication, being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard. Ability to perceive red[7] and orange hues allows tree-dwelling primates to discern them from green. This is particularly important for primates in the detection of red and orange fruit, as well as nutrient-rich new foliage, in which the red and orange carotenoids have not yet been masked by chlorophyll. ^ URL_0  Being able to see *red* made ripe fruits stand out visibly from unripened fruit, and from the green background foliage. I'm sure this influences our ability to appreciate flowers and their vivid contrast to *green.*
Most of the ingredients are the same, though some manufacturers claim that their gendered products are tailored more towards the different areas that each gender tends to shave more. The main difference in ingredients is the scent. Fragrances and oils can be incredibly expensive, which could go towards explaining some of the difference in price. We know women place more emphasis on the fragrance of a product than men (some men being happy to purchase without smelling the product at all). At least when it comes to bathroom products, men and women discriminate on price differently. Men are more likely to take a cheaper product and see that product as equivalent. Women, on the other hand, are more likely to see a more expensive product as superior. Thus reducing price could be a good strategy for men's products but could actually lose you sales on women's.
They could seek out women, but it is illegal to pay someone more or less based solely on their sex, age, etc. That said, the wage gap doesn't really exist in the way that it is often portrayed. Generally speaking there is little to no wage gap for the same work in the same field/position. The wage gap is simply taking all income of full time earners of men vs women in the country and comparing them. This "gap" of all overall earned income between the sexes doesn't take into account actual hours worked, education level, position, fields they elect to go into, etc. Women as a whole tend to work less hours, in jobs that are less stressful/dangerous, have more flexibility with hours and choose to go into fields that are generally less paying than men. This among many other similar factors is what contributes to the vast majority of the wage gap. There's a lot of propaganda and misleading information in the news/media that try to make people believe otherwise, but it goes against all facts and data. It's more of a politically correct argument than a sound/rational one. The truth is that women are more likely to get a degree and in nearly all metropolitan areas of the US single, childless women earn more than men. As these trends continue in favor of women, young men have begun to speak out and advancing the myth of the wage gap is slowly becoming less politically correct as the current generation of workers enter the job market and find that men are actually less "privileged" than women in many regards. The "wage gap" is largely a product of life choices that women and families make for themselves and not something that can be explained squarely as a product of bias in the workplace.
 >  It’s not like the area spontaneously combusts, don’t people have ample time to get to safety? It sort of does spontaneously combust. Imagine a wall of flame approaching at 50+ mph and winds carrying embers which are dropping around you. Each of those might start their own fires in any direction, blocking your movement and vision. Look around your house, how far can you see? Probably not more than a mile or two at most. Once you can see fire you are probably out of time.
When you sell a stock, as in you've hit the "sell" button on your trading platform or called in an order, you're selling it to someone who has hit the "buy" button on his trading platform for the same price. If you sell and no one wants to buy, then your order will just not be filled at that price. Then, depending on your choice of broker or personal settings, your order will be canceled, wait to be filled at the price, or fill at the next available price(s). So pretty much, when you sell a stock, you're selling to some guy who happens to be buying at that moment. If no one's there to buy from you, you'll be left hanging. And vice versa.
Some shots are best given into a muscle, where it then slowly diffuses into the blood stream. Your butt is one of the biggest muscles in your body, so it's a prime target.
Think of the key as a starting point for a typical scale used in a piece of music. Each song will have the same basic scale in order for it to sound pleasing to the ear or, in the right key. Your basic key for music is the key of C, which employs the notes C through G and back to B again, naturally with no "sharps" or "flats." These scales can be offset starting with a different note other than C. After this is done, the pattern of sound differences must be carried over to the new notes by using sharps and flats. Using the C major and G major keys as an example, the C scale would read C,D,E,F,G,A,B, with a smaller pitch gap between E-F and B-C, called a half-step. These small gaps will change based on whether the key is major or minor. With a G major scale, you start on G and implement the half-steps into the same places they would be in the C scale. With Gmaj we see G,A,B,C,D,E,F#(sharp), keeping the half-steps where they should be (B-C, F#-G)
Well, with the Great Dane and Chihuahua the act of mating itself would most likely kill the Chihuahua. But assuming she survived without grievous injury, and became pregnant (or was artificially inseminated) they would have major problems as the pup developed and would likely die from a single pup as it would be larger than they are naturally even with the mix of genes. If the size difference is too great and the female is the small she will almost always die before giving birth due to not being large enough to bring the offspring to term.
If you're driving at what I think you're driving at, the worst that happens is that you'll have a bump from the fluid being trapped under your skin that'll be tender and will be absorbed by your body within a couple of days.
Insurance **is** the reason. Insurance removes the patient from the cost of treatment. When was the last time you think someone shopped around for an X-Ray? They don't. How much is an X-Ray? Who cares, I pay $X per month for insurance and they take care of it. Due to this, there is very little downward pressure on prices as the people doing the "purchasing" are not price sensitive.
The influence of European nations. It became popular through the 20th century in Europe. It became popular as formal wear as official policy in Europe's former colonies (US, South America, and Latin America) imported the design, while their colonies in Asia and Africa adopted/had European fashion preferences forced upon them. Korea never was an European colony. However, it was a a colony of Japan (from 1910 to 1945) after Japan had rapidly industrialized and "westernized" (which included colonial ambitions) after Commodore Matthew Perry had forced Japan open to trade with the threat of Battleships in 1852. So, Japan adopted Western Fashion, and the Koreas adopted it as well.
Five bucks to whoever can actually explain this.
Did you make sure that your question wasn't caught in the spam filter? Message a mod there to make sure. As per your question, you are correct, 600 LY distance means light takes 600 years from one point to the other. Which means that we are not seeing said planet as it is right now, rather we see the planet as it was 600 years ago, when the light left there in our direction. If a large asteroid destroyed said planet today, we would have no way of knowing it until 600 years later, when we would witness the event as if it was happening just now.
Basically the computer program needs to calculate what exactly will appear on each point of the screen, for each frame. It needs to take into consideration the objects that are in the scene, their location and appearance (colors, textures etc.) and especially the lighting.  >  Do they leave the computer turned on until the video renders? Yes.  >  What about a video that takes weeks, or even years? Each frame of the video can be rendered separately. This allows the rendering process to easily split to multiple computers on a server farm - instead of having one computer work for 5 years, you can have 100 computers work for two and a half weeks.
I'll try and make this as simple as possible. Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach are not all classical composers. Before Bach a lot of music was very simple, a single vocal or chorus and maybe an instrument playing too. Bach was ~~an early~~ a later composer in the Baroque era, this era of music introduced much more complexity with multiple instrument parts, but it was still relatively simple music, usually featuring a single lead instrument with backing. Bach is seen as one of the best composers of this era, or at least the quintessential Baroque composer. Mozart was ~~one of the first~~ a classical composers. The classical movement put a lot more emphasis on technical excellence in its music. Instead of the Baroque style of having a single lead instrument and backing pieces classical music would have different parts for every instrument in the orchestra, each instruments sound would weave the fabric of the music. Beethoven wrote music in both Classical and the new Romantic style. The Romantic style took Classical and made it more dramatic. Rather than being about just technical excellence it was about the feel of the music, the ebb and flow. The composer was trying to evoke emotions in the listeners with their music. The music would alter its tempo and timbre, it would quiet down to a single instrument only to explode back into the full orchestra. Each of these musicians is considered the best of their era, each era was considered a leap forward in the philosophy of music. EDIT: A few improvements. EDIT 2: Clarification to answer OP's question. Each of these composers is seen as the height, or quintessential, composer of their respective eras.
No, Saudi Arabia is actually a crazy backwards country that refuses to acknowledge the rights of women. This is for two reasons. They're completely ruled by the royal family, so they don't have to respond to democratic pressure. And they have a lot of oil, so nobody wants to apply that much international pressure.
Because each electric company would need to install their own wires, which makes it costly to enter the market and also if multiple companies did, would mean there would be electrical wires and cables everywhere. The government decided the best thing to do would be allow monopolies but closely regulate them so they don't exploit the customers.
Hacking is the second side of a coin. To find exploits, you need to understand how something works. For example, to do sql exploits, you need to know the syntax and all the common mistakes that developers make during development. Such as adding unsanitized user input to their queries.
"Sir, why do you need a loan?" "My house burned down, and I had no insurance" "What were you planning on using for collateral?" "My house?"
There’s a lot involved here. There have actually been studies on it. Believe it or not though women tend to run warmer than men as far as core body temp goes, though their extremities (hands/feet) are significantly colder than those of a man. It’s quite interesting to see how it’s broken down in [this article]( URL_0 )
Yeah I kind of agree with you on that one. I hate how many times "Explain Quantum dynamics in mathematical terms like i'm five" and the like has been asked on this subreddit. It's kind of become a place where people who haven't paid attention in class go to ask about, like you said, their 200-level classes. That being said, I kind of like that we've moved away from actually talking in baby voice ("pretend that your toy tonka truck fell out of your crib"). We can still use simpler language, but no one is *literally* explaining things to a five-year-old here. If you want that, go over to /r/explainlikeIAmA What this subreddit was designed for, is that if you don't understand what most would consider a simple thing, like how a car works or why protein is good for you, you don't have to go to /r/cars or /r/fitness and get laughed at. You instead get a non-judgmental, simple explanation, much like a five-year-old would asking the same question. That is no excuse for not searching for your question though. there were *103 separate fucking questions* as to what the fiscal cliff was. Not okay.
Conjecture, heard this explanation a long time ago. The tradition started before credit cards and people had to used mechanical registers and cash. If something cost an even 1, 5, or whatever dollars, the employees could easily pocket the cash and call it a loss. To deter from this practice, the managers priced things at a penny below, forcing them to make change. That way they can at least keep track of how many times the registered was opened on who's shift vs sales.
I know someone with years of work at a crisis management center. what i thought was really interesting is she told me when someone calls in and they immediately say they are going to kill themselves, it's a cry for help thing and they don't really worry too much. But if the person talks about everything but suicide, THAT is a huge red flag. like if they start listing all their problems and mistakes. That is when you need to be the most worried because this person has already decided they are going to die, they just want to explain themselves to another person first.
Oh man, this is such a great question! I'm new-ish to reddit and have never posted but I just HAVE to join this discussion :) The short answer is that we don't completely know. There are many, many factors involved and much of it is poorly understood. I'll try to be ELI5 friendly, but if I fail please tell me and I'll try again. Some viruses are very well adapted to their reservoir host. This means that they can "live" within that host without doing much, if any, damage. For humans, herpes viruses could be a good example of this. Most often in this case, the virus has "lived" within that host for a very long time (from an evolutionary perspective). As the host evolves ways to combat the virus, the virus evolves right back. This is called co-evolution. There is a tendency for these viruses to evolve to be less damaging over time. However, if one of these viruses co-evolved to a different host happens to infect a human successfully, it can be... very bad. We are a different host, with different biology and a different immune system. The virus is not "co-evolved" with us and it can make us sick in a way that it doesn't make its other host sick. This is just one aspect of a complex issue, but I hope it helps some. Source: I'm a virologist, focused in emerging pathogens.
I actually do this for a living! The basic answer is that space is so big you don't have to worry so much about impacts. But the larger answer is that we (mankind) has characterized and generalized the meteorite flux to produce tables which say "for an object/spacecraft with a cross section of 1 square meter, N meteors of X diameter and Y velocity will impact every hour." So you take this table and ask yourself how long you want your spacecraft to last, and how likely you want it be that it actually lasts that long. For typical spacecraft that might be... 99.9% chance that you last for 8 years without getting destroyed. You then use something like a Poison distribution plus your table to find the maximum meteorite size that you need to be able to withstand without being destroyed. And lastly you use a meteor penetration model like Cour-Palais or Schmidt Holsapple (sp?) which were developed back in the Apollo days to choose how thick to a make your hull. Eventually... some time after your 8 years, hopefully... a meteor comes around that is bigger than the limit you designed for and then your mission is over. But it's ok, because all good things have to end, son. You're happy. Note those models aren't valid for two layer ("Whipple") shields which are pretty common now. One layer fragments the particle and the other catches the little bits. There are alternative models for this.
First of all, birds are dinosaurs. Second of all, the quadrupedal mode of movement has advantages over bipedal in terms of stability, agility, and power. In order for bipedal modes of movement to win out, you need to make quadrupedal movement disadvantageous or impossible. One way to do that is to evolve delicate, sensitive, hands and an upright posture. Another way is to evolve the forelimbs into wings that cannot be used for walking as opposed to bats who can crawl with their wings.
It encourages people to spend more because it doesn't feel like real money, and also it's easier and cheaper to handle a single financial transaction for a block of points that can be used on many things than it is to have them send money for each thing they buy.
It's actually quite intentional. The Emergency Alert System is designed to be broadcast in case of any emergency, whether it's a weather alert or a Presidential Alert. The system doesn't differentiate where the signal is sent, and is broadcast nationally for each alert, but you don't see the ones that don't apply to you because of those tones at the beginning of the broadcast. The first time the modem noise is played, the EAS is broadcasting information about the affected area, the type of alert, and the originator to the EAS device located at the station. This code is then repeated two additional times in order to ensure that the data was correctly interpreted on the receiving end. The receiver at the broadcast station reads this data, determines automatically if the alert is valid for the broadcast area, and cuts into whatever is playing in order to relay the information. This is the same principal as the handshake your modem used to connect to the internet, but with different data since certain things are assumed (Baud rate, transmission format, frequency, etc.) The three tones at the end of the EAS broadcast are the "End of Message" tones. TL;dr: It's because the alerts are sent by a system that's pretty close to a modem. (edit: Moved a few letters around for clarity's sake.)
Your body goes through natural rhythms of more being sleepy and more alert. When you are asleep, you go from deep to light to dream sleep and back again. Same for when you are awake. If you wake up during deep sleep, you will be more sleepy. You can see this rhyme in lots of places. It explains the post lunch coma, even if you didn't eat a big lunch. If you try to pull an all-nighter, you'll notice some parts of the night when you get super sleepy and others when you are ok. People have different cycles leading to morning larks (morning people) and night owls (people who are more alert at night). Babies have shorter cycles which is why they nap more. The cycle is somewhat regulated by daylight and involves a bunch of hormones in your body like melatonin. Artificial light like phones and TV can disrupt it which is why they advise people not to use phones or watch TV near bedtime. If you put someone in a room with no windows, they daily cycle will eventually stretch to 36 hours.
there's a little bit more to it. Her father is in congress, and he was critical in a process that created a government requirement to keep a supply of epi-pens in all public schools, shortly before the price hike. now, some people feel like this may be some corruption at work, for obvious reasons.
I saw this on another thread so I'll repost it here.. credit to redditor /u/thef1guy The U.S strategy is what military planners call 'funnelling'. The objective wasn't to destroy ISIL(S) command  &  control centers, but funnel their attacking routes towards the Assad troops. When CIA backed rebels are cornered by ISIL advancements, the coalition will launch defensive strikes to deter them from an advancement, thereby pushing them towards Assad forces instead. This is the reason the U.S  &  its coalition have dropped thousands of precision strikes with little dent to ISIL(S)'s force projection and growth in the ground. If the U.S really wanted to destroy the core of ISIL(S), they would have done so already. Russia has clearly observed that the 'funneling' strategy was cornering Assad's forces, with the CIA supported rebels  &  ISIL(S) hitting them on both fronts. Assad's supply lines were stretched and the regime was close to collapsing. Russia had to intervene and this time, their strikes are actual, targeting anything which is not Syrian government and its clear this is starting to rattle the opposing forces and disrupting the U.S military strategy. The Russians are not stupid, they have enough intel to know what's going on and reacted at the perfect time.
It sounds like you're unfamiliar with humans if you're asking that question...  & nbsp; Ignoring religious views, sex is a nontrivial topic because it can lead to pregnancy (for heterosexuals) and complicate/ruin a friendship between the partners (for any sexuality). The burden of having an unplanned child can be enormous if you're unprepared mentally or financially, and it can be worsened if pregnancy occurs with a random partner (namely, someone to whom you ask, "wanna fuck in my van?").  & nbsp; Ignoring pregnancy, your relationship with a sexual partner can be harmed if sex is "unsuccessful" (e.g., partner 1 didn't enjoy sex with partner 2 and no longer wants sex from this partner. partner 2 still wants sex with partner 1). It can be difficult to distinguish between platonic and sexual feelings for many people.  & nbsp; Lastly, sex can make you physically vulnerable, in the sense that you do it in a private place (e.g., someone's home) and while naked and without immediate access to your personal belongings. This means both partners should trust each other at some level.  & nbsp; These things combined, many people are hesitant to have sex with partners when they aren't already in a relationship.  & nbsp; **Edit**: Many people pointed out that I didn't fully address OP's question and I agree. My guess *why* sex can harm a good friendship is as follows: It might be the limbo of not having a well defined relationship that makes it awkward between non-dating people who have sex together. If you have sex with someone and then start dating, then your relationship has become more concrete and you can make plans for it. If you have sex but don't start dating, then it's unclear whether you two should escalate your relationship into a long-term intimate one, or if you are still available to date other people. Uncertainty in relationships (without considering pregnancy) can be uncomfortable and even frightening.
Nothing. Personally, I never click popups. You can easily get rid of them by: - F12 (open devtools) - click the "Select Element" button (top left of devtools, looks like a mouse cursor) - mouse over the popup so it is highlighted and click (won't trigger a normal click) - adjust if the popup is inside an iFrame or similar - right click the element and "delete" - profit. (With practice, this takes me ~1-2 seconds) Edit: Apparently this can be brought down to about 15ns using /u/ajgz 's shortcuts below :)
Real answer: The tissue inside your nose isn't very thick and has tons of specialized nerve cells right at the surface, which means that when a pore swells with infection (a zit), the skin is pulled tight and the pressure under the already thin tight skin pushes against all those nerves, causing signals to fire and increasing the painful sensation. Plus there just isn't much space in there.
Juries decide issues of *fact* (did such and such actually happen). Judges decide issues of *law* (who is allowed to testify, what questions are allowed to be asked, who has the burden of proof, what facts must be proved to establish a particular crime). So, for example, in an ordinary rape case, the judge might explain to the jury that they need to decide whether the victim actually consented to a sex act, but in a statutory rape case, the judge might explain to the jury that it doesn't matter whether the minor consented to sex or lied about their age. These are points of law that you wouldn't expect an average juror to know going into the trial.

They can. A far-sighted person just needs the near-point of focus brought near enough so they can read. You can easily check this yourself, and it doesn't matter what it does to your vision for other distances, because you take them off for other purposes. A near-sighted person needs the exact amount of adjustment to correct their far-focus to infinity. (Without glasses, my far-focus point is about 10 inches.) Any increase in strength beyond that will move their near-focus point further out, so they can't read. They have to wear their glasses all the time, so this would be intolerable. Near-sighted people generally are capable of the full range of accommodation; it's just that the set-point is wrong so that it doesn't match the real world requirement. One you fix the set-point, they can have basically perfect vision. When people need reading glasses as they get older, it's because the lenses in their eyes have gotten less flexible. They no longer have the full range of accommodation. This means that they can not regain perfect vision with a single change to the set-point, so getting it exactly right is less important, and as I said, you can do it roughly yourself. EDIT: The other part of the equation is the people who wear strong corrective lenses all the time want designer frames, special high-refractive-index glass and correction of up to 10 diopters or more. That's why my glasses are an order of magnitude (or two) more expensive than pharmacy reading glasses. OK it does feel like a bit of a scam sometimes.
Control over desires. And realistically a large part is that it's a constant reminder and 'investment' in the group. Take the whole Mecca prayer thing. That's a reminder many times a day, and if you were to stop you'd feel pretty stupid for having wasted your time. So you're invested and reminded. The same with this. Add in a good dash of self-loathing, and "I work so hard for the group. No one else has this problem, I do because I'm a dirty person", and you've got a valuable tool. Wish I was joking, and you can justify it away a dozen different ways, but at it's core that's your answer. It's a reminder and investment.
On the flip side of that, it is perfectly legal for you to quit your job without any notice and be hired somewhere else. "At will" works both ways.
When people hack sites for passwords, they usually get a list of the hashed passwords. That means when you put in your password, the site can check if it's the same password you signed up with but it doesn't know what the password is. It's like a one-way secret message. The way hackers figure out passwords is they know common hashing techniques and they guess common passwords using those techniques. Since "password123" is a common password, they'll put that in the hash, see what comes out, and match that output to the stolen list of hashed passwords they got. If they can't guess your password to input, then they won't be able to know what it is. Complex passwords make it harder to guess the hashed passwords once they're stolen. The biggest factors for making a password hard to guess are the total numbers of characters you can use and the length. So forcing you to have three special characters and two capitals and a number doesn't really help, but allowing you to use any character and requiring your password to be long does help. In other words, "a%6L7" looks like a more securepassword than"!XthisismypasswordforthissiteX!", but the latter is actually more secure since it's longer and can possibly use just as many symbols. Longer passwords are harder to guess because the possible combinations of guesses increase quickly as you add additional characters.
 >  What citizenship does child hold? It obviously varies by the laws of each country, but generally the child will get the citizenship of its parents (the same would happen if the child was born while the parents were on vacation).  >  Does the child also get free flights for life? That's up to the airline to decide.
If you're the driver you're in direct control of the sensations you're experiencing. Its your input on the steering wheel or throttle pedal or whatever that's causing the things you're feeling now; being pulled to one side, or being pushed back in the seat, or being shifted forward into the seatbelt, whatever. If you're a passenger, this stuff just happens to you, and some people can deal with that better than others. Motion sickness is theorised to be caused by a disconnect between what you're feeling and what your eyes are seeing; your brain thinks there's something wrong, so makes you throw up to at least limit the possibility of poisoning. Some are more sensitive to that disconnect than others and it can work in both ways. I know people who can quite happily sit in the back of a car and read a book and I also used to know someone who played the original GTA, (yes [this one]( URL_0 )), and got motion sickness from that. Of course in that case he was still and what he was seeing wasn't. As I say how sensitive an individual is to it will vary.
I have often heard the generalization that eastern cultures tend to be more "collectivist" (focused on family/community/society) whereas western cultures tend to be more "individualist" (focused on the individual/independence). While I don't know if this is true or not, I think the western culture part of this generalization fits with what I've experienced as someone living in North America. There is a lot of emphasis on becoming self-sufficient as you reach adulthood. Continuing to live with your parents after a certain age is often seen as not providing for yourself and therefore being a burden to your parents.
you can give up your citizenship and become a citizen of another country. However citizenship is not the deciding factor in being able to be persecuted under US law, being in the country is. If you are in the US and commit a crime here the US has jurisdiction over you no matter what country you are a citizen of. You can't for example travel to Canada punch someone and when the Canadian cops arrive to arrest you tell them that they don't have jurisdiction over you because you are an American citizen.
Go hiking for several miles. Blisters and hotspots are a common injury. Many native people who walk barefoot, and long distance walkers develop a thick layer of hard dead skin on their feet to protect themselves.
At least for livestock it is determined a lot by the frequency of ejaculation, the age of the animal, and the techniques used to collect semen (basically the psychological/physiological stimulation). I've collected bull and boar semen and assisted with collection of stallions and rams. I'll use bulls for example. Yearling bulls produce much less ejaculate than a four or five year old bull, which is why you wouldn't leave a young bull responsible for breeding more than twenty cows out in the field. When collecting bulls artificially, you could collect using electroejaculation (using a probe to electrically stimulate the prostate), or you could let him mount a cow/dummy and collect it in a sleeve or condom. No bull on the planet likes the electroejaculation, and this method is almost exclusively used to put semen under a microscope to inspect semen and confirm that the sperm are all normal. Why is it only used to test semen quality? Because so little volume in ejaculated when using this method. Now when you get into real bull collections, where companies buy $100k bulls and collect semen from each animal twice a week- volume is important. More volume = more money. For bulls, stallions, and boars (Artificial insemination and semen collection is very rare in rams and the sheep world) - it's very common to find companies that take important notes about each individual male's preferences. Some get special handlers they like. Some have a specific dummy, or a custom-made artificial vagina. Many of these animals get into a routine that they like and, just like humans, each animal needs just the right stimulation to ejaculate. Getting their preferences right results in the largest and most high quality ejaculate. This is why collector's invest so much time and money into recording what each animal likes. So at least in the animals world, most mammals' ejaculate is determined by age, frequency of ejaculation, and tastes/preferences. I think it would be safe to assume some of these translate over to humans.
One of the primary personality types of those that settled the US was that they did not trust government, nor did they trust media. Everyone is always trying to manipulate what you see and think and so everything has to be taken with a grain of salt and tested for its validity.
Coming from a Scientologist family myself, I will try to explain my understanding of the beliefs in a non-biased manner. I do not have a perfect grasp on it, as I do not practice it myself (I'm Agnostic, and my parents know you can't force something like religion on someone who doesn't want it). I'll say this up front: I do not know it the Xenu is true or not. I've never heard the name Xenu it mentioned in my house or any times I have been dragged along to the local Mission. From my own viewpoint, it doesn't seem to fit in with what I've seen of the group, but it could be that it's kept for higher-ups. Now, a quick disclaimer: I have never done any of the religious Scientology courses, such as Dianetics. I have, however, been shown the movie a couple of times in the past, so I will summarize the beliefs to my understanding. There may be information missing, or some things I have misunderstood. I do not represent Scientology in any way. Now, let's get onto it. I'll begin by explaining some terminology I know. Scientologists believe in the Thetan, which is comparable to a soul. It's the "essence" of the person (more or less the personality, from what I can gather), not having to do with the body or anything else physical. Scientologists believe that the mind is split into two parts: The Analytical Mind, and the Reactive mind. The Analytical Mind, as you might have guessed, is more or less conscious thought. It's what you would use to read this post, or do a simple mathematics problem. The Reactive Mind, however, is more along the lines of instinct and thoughts and feelings you do not have control over. An important thing to take note of is that they believe that the mind is ALWAYS recording what is going on, even if one is unconscious. (Ironically, it's my observation that the idea of the Reactive Mind is almost identical to Freud's theory of the Unconscious Mind, which most Scientologists I know eschew.) One thing you will hear about when talking about Scientology are the Dynamics. They are "urges towards survival" though many different mediums. The first Dynamic, for example, is through yourself. Cleaning yourself, feeding yourself and getting yourself better when you're sick are all examples of surviving through your First Dynamic. These Dynamics expand outwards from yourself (think of concentric circles, with the First Dynamic at the heart), moving to survival through your family and reproduction, to survival though groups (such as your basketball team), to mankind as a whole. From there the dynamics begin to cover more broad areas, such as all living things, all physical matter (called MEST, Matter Energy Space and Time), spirits, and the Supreme Being (or whatever you want to call it, also known as the Infinity Dynamic). Now, it is Scientology belief that people are all basically good. They want to do good acts and survive with their fellow beings along all eight Dynamics. The reason this doesn't happen, however, is because of aberrations in their nature called Engrams. Engrams are caused when some form of traumatic experience happens to a person, such as getting sick, getting hurt, or other such phenomenon. Engrams can frequently be made when one becomes unconscious. Engrams cause people to act in weird, irrational ways. For example, let's say a person became sick by eating a hard-boiled egg that had gone bad. From then on, he would have an Engram stemming from that event, and become sick when confronted with another hard-boiled egg, whether or not he remembers that original sickness. This is where auditing comes in. Now, I have never been audited, but I will do my best to explain what the end result is. The goal of auditing is to become "Clear", or to get rid of all engrams from your current life, including ones that happened while you were in the womb (called pre-natal engrams. I have my own personal criticisms towards this theory, but I'll keep them in check. They are explained by your Reactive Mind recording the sounds and sensations outside the womb, which your mind can figure out when it becomes more developed.). There are different courses in different areas after you become Clear, but I know little of them, outside the fact that you eventually do auditing for engrams outside this life. I could tell a bit more about some nomenclature that they have, but I feel like that's a basic understanding of Dianetics and their basic beliefs. I would be happy to tell about my own experiences with Scientologists, and the Study Technology they use, as well as any other questions you may have. Edit: TL;DR: Basics of Dianetics, Auditing, and other beliefs that I can't explain in a TL;DR sentence. Go read it if you want to be a bit more informed.
They would have no physical addiction. They would go through withdrawal while unconscious. But they'd still be addicted psychologically, much like a person who quits for awhile--they will still crave the substance, but not become physically ill when not having any. It's actually a thing to put people to sleep so they can detox while unconscious.
I've spent ten years working in hotel lounges and bars. Less staff to monitor safety precautions. A lot of guests seem to think that general rules don't apply when in hotels. That they are in an island void of rules. People are found opening drinking, having sex, naked, etc. in pool and gym areas all the time. The things that go on in hotels... It's kind of gross. I've walked in on people filming porn in their rooms. I was delivering the room service they had ordered.
You'll never believe why this is such an effective use of ad space! ELI5 version: Imagine you are fishing. A net might catch a lot of fish, but it's expensive and must be thrown into a targeted area. But imagine putting a really REALLY tasty bit of special fish food on a hook. Actually, it could taste like shit. The only important part is the smell. That really REALLY good smell attracts a fish. The fish bites the hook. Now... it doesn't really matter if they like the taste or not. The fisher got what he wanted. Lots of other fish might have recognized that smell and thought, that's obvious shit masked with a yummy odor, but a few fish will bite it. These people don't care if their articles are shit. They want your click. It's effective because it works like bait, not a net. If I wrote an informative article I wouldn't advertise it. People looking for it would find it via google. A clickbait article is more like using bait, people are lured to it by that yummy smell without actually looking for it. It's effective because it works. There is an entire industry around it. People make a living by writing clickbait articles. We all know exactly what they are... and I bet we STILL click on them from time to time because... well, we take the bait.
Machine-made generally means something that's designed for mass manufacturing. There are shortcuts in the design, because it has to be efficient to manufacture in quantity. The materials involved also have to be suitable for mass manufacturing and, ideally, inexpensive. A good craftsman can do much better work. This involves skill, time, and generally better materials, because there's no point in wasting skill and time on inferior work.
I'm not aware of particular legislation that actually makes it more severe if you don't know they were police. That said, juries are typically going to be more prone to convict someone of a more serious offense in the typical shooting an undercover cop than the typical shooting of an average citizen. 1. The type of person who shoots an undercover cop is usually in a position with fewer redeeming qualities and was probably not up to any good in the events leading up to the shooting. 2. The jury will be especially sympathetic to the victim, a police officer killed in the line of duty, whether or not the shooter knew. 3. I'd imagine that the reason for undercover cops getting shot is due to the fact that they are found to be police officers, in which case other offenses may apply and juries will have zero sympathy.
Teeth don't have cells. Healing takes place when cells divide to replace cells that were lost. Your teeth were grown inside your body and then pushed out. Our DNA is only programmed to do this with 2 sets.
I worked on a window-washing robot that cleaned acres of rooftops over a huge commercial greenhouse. Worked great, except when it didn't, and would either break down completely or just get lost and start climbing the wrong parts of the structure. Then repair techs and manual window washers still have to be employed. I think this ends up being a cost/benefit problem where the reliability of our robots and price of implementation isn't quite at the point where it makes this commercially viable for skyscrapers. For what it's worth, I think the Twin Towers actually used a washer robot on the upper floors to limited success.
University Biology student here. The correct answer is: No one knows, and there is no real scientific evidence to help us understand why. NOW there are really good theories, as mentioned below, like abiogenesis. BUT it's not the like theory of evolution. (one of the most solidly 'proven' theories out there. ) There are literally mountains of evidence for evolution. The evidence for abiogenesis is, well, hypothetical at best in my humble opinion. I do believe it, but more than likely, all life on this planet was the result of the evolution of some type of [self replicating amino acid,]( URL_0 )after which evolving life would be a simple matter of time and good environmental conditions.
Geneticist here! CRISPR (or CRISPR-Cas9, if you want the full name), is a big improvement in how we genetically modify organisms. All organisms, from single-cell bacteria, to plants, to animals, to humans, have long molecules inside of them, called DNA. The pattern of different molecules in this chain of DNA, called the *genetic code,* provides instructions for building those bacteria/plants/animals. Tiny little machines inside those cells read the genetic code and use those instructions to make every part of the organism, so that it can grow and reproduce! Now, one of the really cool things about DNA is that, because it's the "blueprint" for making an organism, we can make changes to the DNA and see the results in the resulting organisms! For example, if we insert the instructions for producing a green fluorescent protein (called GFP for short) in a bacteria's DNA, that bacteria will make the protein, and will glow green under fluorescent light! Unfortunately, inserting a new chunk of instructions into DNA isn't as easy as making a change to a set of blueprints. We can manipulate DNA when it's isolated from an animal, on its own, but there's no way to build a new organism around that naked DNA. If we want to change an organism, we need to get at the DNA inside the cells, without killing them. In addition, cells don't like getting random chunks of DNA shoved at them. They see this as a threat, and will destroy that DNA. So in order to get a chunk of DNA to stay in a cell, we need to incorporate it into the cell's own DNA - merge it in, like glueing a new sheet into the blueprints. In order to add a chunk of foreign DNA, we need to add our chunk inside the cell, break the cell's own DNA somewhere, and then get the cell to fix its DNA by sticking our inserted chunk into the gap. Three tasks. **Task 1:** getting the foreign chunk of DNA into a cell, can be accomplished by using electricity or soap to temporarily "pop" the cell's membrane. Obviously, this doesn't work well on adult humans, but it works great on bacteria and single cells. **Task 2:** Breaking the cell's DNA somewhere. This is the really tricky part. Using certain (very nasty and dangerous) chemicals can make the DNA break in random places, but this is dangerous; what if we break the DNA in the middle of a gene that we need? Our cells will die! This is where CRISPR comes in. CRISPR is a combination of a scissor-like protein and a DNA guide that lets it only cut at very specific chosen locations. Unlike old methods, we can be very precise with where we cut the cell's own DNA. We can cut to turn off a gene, or cut at a place where there's nothing but junk so that we can insert our own foreign DNA pieces! **Task 3:** Close the DNA back up, fixing those cuts - with our inserted chunk inside. Fortunately, cells have the machinery to repair DNA cuts on their own! That was easy! ****** **So, CRISPR is a molecular pair of scissors that cuts DNA in very precise locations.** There are still big challenges with genetic engineering - it's tough to get these scissors into a cell, the foreign chunk of DNA doesn't always get inserted, and the CRISPR scissors can still miss and cut in the wrong places. But this is a huge advancement in making more precise cuts, a very important part in creating an organism with new abilities. Feel free to ask questions!
Brian Williams wasn't fired. He was suspended for 6 months. It's also worth noting that Williams and O'Reilly work for different networks and are involved in completely separate controversies. Furthermore, Williams is an anchor on a national news program, while O'Reilly hosts an opinion-based show. The two controversies are being handled by different organizations, so there's no requirement that their punishments must be similar.
Old stone bridges that are still standing probably had their footings build on solid rock or very stable earth. By contrast, your driveway was poured onto earth that moved or eroded under it. Fortunately, cracked driveways are still safe to use, unlike cracked bridges. Edit:typo
Laying down the infrastructure and planning the implementation of the fibre optic network takes a lot of time and money. It has to be built around the needs of the city and the existing infrastructure (pipelines, roads, power etc)
I think at the very beginning stands hygiene: You can easily get rid of lice by shaving, this "cleaning" aspect is especially true if you are in an area with little water so washing is hard. Starting from that you have "fashion", which is responsible for all kinds of odd behaviour you cannot explain. As soon as you have a society where you show that you do not have to spend your day working for life but have time for other things (you are "rich" or "noble" or whatever it is in the current society called) tending after your body (muscles, cleanlyness, clothing and of course hair, makeup, ..., and beard) becomes a thing you can do to "show off" and what you can "afford". Again, fashion does hit and also embraces beards. There are many signs of a higher social status, as brighter skin (not working outside all day), soft hands (not working at all), fancy clothing, fancy hair, etc... beards (in general or the lack of one) are just part of that. The above is also true for soldiers etc, as others have stated. Discipline is, even in modern armies, tied to how soldiers tend to their body. That is first true to keep up the fighting ability, but also discipline and self-image. I read a theory that the modern view on "super clean shaven" of the modern man started both with the industrialised cheap razor, so everyone could afford it, as well as with the first World War, where people liked to be *very* cleanly shaven so the gas mask would sit as tight as possible.
Garlic's pungent, but generally pleasant smell is due to a variety of sulfur compounds. As these are broken down by bacteria and our digestive systems, these sulfur compounds convert into much less pleasant smelling ones. This is only partially what makes garlic breath so pungent. Some of the metabolic products enter our bloodstream and are subsequently volatilized through our lungs. This is why no amount of mouthwash, brushing your teeth, or chewing gum can get rid of garlic breath (these only mask it temporarily).
Nothing is free. While they might not share your data, they look at it. I put a file on one of the "free" storage servers as a test (it wasn't Google, but I'm not convinced they don't do the same thing). It was a Word doc and it had 10 words in it. They were just arbitrary words. Not even 24 hours later I started noticing that all the ads I saw were for things about these words. The funny part is that one of the words was bra. I'm a man and I don't need one, but all of a sudden I'm seeing bra ads.
I hate to be "that guy," but most commenters are missing the point. Society punishes drunk drivers because they do something dangerous after choosing to drink so much that it impairs them. They might beyond making good decisions at the time they choose to drive, but at some point they chose to get super drunk. With sex, we are not punishing the drunk person at all. We are punishing someone else for taking advantage of someone who is so drunk they cannot give consent. Source: I'm a criminal lawyer (and not in the sense that most lawyers are criminals :) )
[Archimedes principle]( URL_0 ) states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces and acts in the upward direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid. So, as long as the weight of the amount of water displaced by the object is ~~less~~ *more* than the object itself, the object will float regardless of how much other water there happens to be. Edit: fixed
As a recreational shooter I would love to have a silencer at the range, so I could skip having to use earpro with subsonic rounds. I would also like to have a silencer when recreationally shooting in BLM land, because I don't particularly enjoy making a lot of noise and annoying people for no reason. That being said, actual silencers don't last that long and re-baffling them is a lot of effort.
The video most likely is not sufficient evidence. The video shows what appears to be the smoking of crack but without supporting evidence such as the pipe with residue on it, witnesses who were present, the video itself is of little evidentiary value.

Retail has always been a challenging business due to cash flow issues for maintaining inventory, selecting the correct inventory, etc. Certainly eCommerce has hurt a great deal... both because people choose it out of convenience and also because it allows for easy price comparison shopping. It cuts down on margins and means stores have to be more competitive on pricing as well as experience. Those that are failing also fall into a middle ground where they are neither discount nor luxury. Shoppers used to stick to particular chains based on socioeconomic class — you were Wal-Mart people, JC Penny people, Nordstrom people, etc. Now people trade up and down all the time in particular categories. So those who would’ve shopped at high end stores might buy their work suits there but buy cheap workout clothes at Wal-Mart. The lower income person who loves to cook might splurge on luxury cookware while shopping dollar stores for everything else. And due to cash limitations, chains like Sears, K-Mart and JC Penny haven’t invested in modernizing stores or category mix to entice shoppers in. They feel dated and depressing so people don’t want to shop there. They are more costly than all out discounters and frumpier than quick fashion places like H & M, etc. or outlet store options. They don’t offer the glamor or style of high end places. They don’t offer the prices of Home Depot or national electronics/appliance retailers.
I think it has to do with the number of competitors each gender produces. There are just more men who compete in sports. Think of two high school football teams. One high school has 200 students in the student body. The other high school has 4000. Even though there are only 11 players on the field per team at any given time in a football game, the 4,000 student school's team will likely be better because it has a larger talent pool to draw from. Competition also plays a factor. Most of the time, men and women don't see themselves directly competing. When you're better than everyone else you see yourself competing with, it's hard to push yourself further. Think of if you're in high school running a mile race. You run it in 5 minutes and all of your competitors run it in 7 minutes. Clearly your better than your competition, but had you been running against people who can also run it in 5 minutes, your time would likely have been faster because you were being pushed.
When beach towns try to ban thongs, they also tend to come up with rather contorted legal definitions of what constitutes a "naked" butt. And ~~in~~ **from the 1790s into** the early 19th century, before "Victorianism" really got started, a fashionable woman could reveal almost all of her breasts in an evening gown. But a generation or so later, even a glimpse of upper cleavage was considered semi-obscene. Times and definitions change. EDIT: Correction for accuracy
Egg yolks are incredible emulsifiers; they help fat-based and water-based substances form finer blends. If you took a (pasteurized) raw egg yolk and added to it your salad dressing of oil and vinegar, you'd find that the the whole thing would form a creamy suspension that would stay together for a while. Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks. The bonus is that the fat in the yolks, and the water in the whites already have an emulsifier in the yolk; the egg is a complete kit to emulsify itself and anything else. An omelette, or scrambled eggs, is just such an emulsion, cooked. On its own, the white can also be whipped up into a tight froth and used to add air and volume to something that would otherwise not be raised, such as meringue, souffle, or mousse. When you add all of those things and use them in different combinations, you have the reason for eggs popularity in cuisine.
You don't have to reheat chicken. It just has to be cooked thoroughly the 1st time.

Just because children don't have an adult's capacity to fully reason through the consequences of their actions doesn't mean that they are completely incapable of understanding the consequences of some actions at the same level as an adult. Understanding that murder is wrong is not a particularly complex principle to comprehend. If it is shown that the minor is mature enough to understand this concept, then saying the the minor is too young to be responsible for it doesn't make sense.
I believe what you've heard of is the free radical aging theory. To be clear, in this terminology 'aging' is referring to the decline of the body through the accumulation of damage caused by free radicals in your cells. So if you are defining 'aging quicker' as acquiring more damage faster, and so having a shorter lifespan, there is some experimental evidence to suggest this is at least part of the equation. I just want to differentiate this from some sort of 'passage of time' concept. However, this isn't the oxygen your breathe (or well, if it is, you're about to die). These reactive types of oxygen are products of metabolic processes in your body. Impacts to this type of damage to the body involve events that increase the production of free radicals, or decrease the ability of your body to clean them up. Obviously, denying your body enough oxygen to engage in metabolic activity might thwart the production entirely, but it's a bit of a lose-lose proposition.
You are paying the cable company to connect you. The channels have to support themselves, so mostly do it via adverts. Rather like paying for the internet but seeing adverts on websites.
A defibrillator 'resets' a heart in a way. If you have a bad rhythm, it stops it (hopefully), so that it can start back up with a correct rhythm. If your heart has *stopped,* something is wrong with it. Maybe it is damaged, has insufficient supply, and so on. Trying to stop it *harder* doesn't fix the problem. Defibrillators don't repair hearts.
I'm a broker. I have never seen the trading floor as I sit at a computer all day. The trading floor serves a few purposes. One of them is volume. There are many traders who trade their own (very large) accounts in the pit. They make extremely fast trades based on reading what others in the pit are doing (based on customer orders) as a way to read the market. It's also tradition. It exists because people don't want to get rid of it, despite how useless it is. It puts a face on trading. It's fast disappearing and the markets will be fine without it.
You program it in another language. A lot of languages popular today, like PHP, were originally implemented in C/C++. Basically the PHP interpreter is a C program that accepts text input formatted as proper PHP, and does the thing that the PHP is asking for. C++ was itself originally implemented in C. It started out as a compiler written in C. C itself was made by writing a compiler in assembly language. Assembly language was made by writing an assembler directly in binary. (Or 'compiling by hand', which means manually turning readable code into unreadable, but functionally identical, binary that can run on the machine natively.) Binary works because that's how it was engineered. Computer engineers made the circuits that actually do the adding, push or whatever. They also made it so that you could specify what to do with 'op codes' and arguments. A simple, but made up, example CPU might use the opcode 0000 for adding, and accept two 4 bit numbers to add. In that language if I told the CPU 000000010001 it'd add 1 and 1 together and do... whatever it was designed to do with the result. So now we're at the bottom. Ultimately all code ends up coming down here to the binary level.
We essentially vomit at the sight of gory or bloody death as a defense mechanism. In the face of corpses or death, we are often at risk ourselves, and therefore vomit to remove possible biohazards from our system that may have been spread by the dead, as blood and gore are often good at transmitting biohazards. It also prevents us from possibly ingesting any biohazards by forcing everything out of the mouth that may have been headed for the stomach (i.e. blood).
Purely to make money. The singles release to great fanfare, get fresh radio plays, people who didn't hear about the album might buy them. They normally have demos or stuff that didn't make it on the album to persuade die-hard fans to shell out for them.
A lot of it isn't legal, and is copyright infringement. (Most of such art is copyright infringement whether being sold or not, by the way.) But copyright is civil in nature, not criminal--the rights holder has to request a court to enforce the law. It does not matter that I infringe on the copyright of The Pokemon Company if they choose not to sue me. Most companies have better things to do than to generate bad press by suing small-time artists.
Also, there are ranges of lactose intolerance and maybe you can train yourself to be less so. I'm East Asian and most of us are lactose intolerant. My father grew up in a country  &  at a time when young people did not regularly have dairy products. He can't drink any milk without having some problems. I can tolerate up to a pint of milk I think. I never thought I was lactose intolerant until I chugged a quart of chocolate milk after a hard workout. That was a shitty night.
Your brain naturally produces chemicals like melatonin that "signal" your brain that it is time to sleep/rest. Your brain adjusts to light cycles and signals that it is time to sleep. However signaling to sleep doesn't factor into total deep sleep, where your body recovers the most. Also there is always outside stimulation when you are asleep, also factoring in what you ate and what you did during the day. Tldr: Your brain has established cycles for deep sleep, but various factors can affect how much actual sleep you get (ex. Food, drugs, dreams, position, good old genetics) Edit: it's also worthwhile to note, you used uncomfortable position as your example. The body responses to uncomfortable-ness (pretend it's a word) with signals of distress, which could potentially wake you up. Edit: Alphora corrected a misleading point I made, REM is NOT the stage in which the most recovery is had. He pointed out that this happens in the deepest sleep, in stage 3 NREM.
Yes, you would. After fifteen years selling shoes, I can tell you that you would be wrong. There are several reasons: 1. Different styles for different purposes necessarily have different fits. A ballet flat or a pump has to grab a girl's toes and hold on for dear life... which is why I don't recommend wearing them if you can help it. But to have that look, they must necessarily fit poorly, because there are no laces or straps to adjust. Athletic or hiking shoes, made to properly fit a human foot during a given activity, always fit better on any foot. 2. It's a hell of a thing to fit a human foot, which is a three-dimensional object that has three distinct shapes: walking, standing, and sitting. The same shoe has to fit the same foot when it has three different sets of dimensions, depending on what you're doing. 3. As a man, my clothes are marked in inches, but that doesn't mean I can get Levis, American Eagle, Hugo Boss, and Armani to even agree how big a damn inch is when they make my pants, so why should we expect New Balance, Clarks, Allen Edmonds, and Keen to agree on how big a size 9 is? tl;dr It's just one of those things. Whaddya gonna do?
1. When you die, that's it, you're dead. As a result, matches are very short, and every encounter is very intense. No five-second countdown to respawn. A lot of people prefer this to more drawn-out gameplay. 2. Builds progress over a series of matches, with winning teams getting more money. So round 1 you might skip body armor or grenades so you can afford a better gun in round 2 instead of having to wait for round 3. With no need to rank up, you can have that sick sniper rifle the same time anyone else can in the match. 3. Longevity and stability. COD changes its formula in various ways all the time, adding new guns, new killstreaks, messing around with death streak bonuses and the like. Gameplay in Counterstrike is largely the same as it has been since its inception, meaning that people who have been following it for years can still make sense of it. 4. Lower barrier to entry/upkeep. CS:GO is $15, and has been the latest version of CS since 2012. In that time, COD has released 3 new entries at $60 apiece. So if you're broke, you can play CS for a relatively low entry.

Drinking before you turn 21 is absolutely illegal. In some situations people are more tolerant of underage drinking (college, at home during family gatherings maybe), but the law is pretty clear. You're definitely not going to be able to get a drink at a public place like a bar/pub/restaurant.
No, the general thought is that there is no center. Everything is moving away from everything else and there is no central point.
The US thought that the concept of "The Nation of Iraq" was something that the people there cared about. A US soldier will fight to the bitter end to defend an American city he's never been to filled with people he's never met. That's not the case in Iraq. The people there have much stronger allegiances to their religious, ethnic, and tribal groups than the nation as a whole. The Shiite Arab soldiers in the army would rather leave the Sunni arabs and Kurds to their fate than bother protecting them. The Sunni Arab soldiers in the army would rather let ISIS crush the Shiite led government and worry about the whole Sharia BS later. The Kurds have their own military force that operates independently of the Iraqi military and has been far more effective. Edit: There's some good discussion in the later posts on this comment, so I'll address a few of them: 1) Why hasn't there been any serious discussion of a three state solution? There are a few reasons behind this (although it is a likely outcome in the long term). For starters, the Shiites [control much of the arable land near the persian gulf]( URL_0 ) (Thanks to u/perevod for the map). The Sunnis have been mostly ejected from Baghdad and the surrounding areas over the years. When carving up an oil rich, difficult to farm territory like Iraq you'll inevitably get conflicts about who owns what. Neither side is likely to peacefully yield valuable farmland and oil fields to the other, regardless of who is currently residing there. There's also the Turkey problem. There are large populations of Kurds in Syria and Turkey. The Iraqi and Syrian Kurds are effectively autonomous at this point, those In iraq have their own government, military, and utilities infrastructure. The Syrian government has little influence in Kurdish regions of Syria, preferring to defend their strongholds and let the Kurdish Peshmerga, FSA, and ISIS fight over the rest. The Kurds in Turkey have been fighting an on-and-off war of independence to break away from Turkey and join their Iraqi and Syrian brothers in forming an independent Kurdish state. Turkey strongly opposes this and the US has been reluctant to support the Kurdish forces in ways that will strengthen the independence movement. The US and Turkey have been close allies since the Cold War, but the relationship has broken down in recent years as the region has destabilized. 2) Why hasn't Bashar Al-Assad's military dissolved like the Iraqi military? A large number of Syrian military forces actually did defect to the Free Syrian Army early in the conflict, but they weren't able to hold off the more numerous (and better funded) loyalist forces in the long term. The loyalist forces are a minority religious sect known as the Alawites, and they've been targets of harassment and oppression in the region for centuries. Al-Assad's remaining forces are fiercely loyal because they're defending their people from discrimination at the hands of the rebels and execution at the hands of ISIS. There is a similar situation forming in Iraq. The Sunni members of the military have largely disappeared since ISIS is a Sunni group and treats them reasonably well. The Shiite members have retreated to the Shiite territory and joined forces with the old [Shiite militias]( URL_1 ). Together they actually do form a formidable fighting force, one that will be able to defend Baghdad from ISIS indefinitely if it comes to that. In both countries you're seeing the military splinter along religious and ethnic lines, with the ruling party's forces staying loyal but opting to only defend their territory, not the nation as a whole. It all comes back to the original issue, there is no Iraq and there is no Syria. There are Alawites, Sunnis, and Shiites. There are Arabs, Persians, and Kurds. There are many groups fighting for many things, but none of them care much for the notion of Iraq and Syria in their 20th century form.
Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do. The trade you are discussing has happened in the past, and is likely happening today. In finance parlance, this is known as a carry trade. The best known carry trade was in the 90's, going short (selling, or owing) the Japanese yen and going long (buying, or owning) the US dollar. The key to the carry trade is exactly what you described. It is not simply a matter of being short one currency and long another, but it is being short one currency and long another with a view towards profiting off of the interest rate differentials. In the JPY/USD example, you would be selling JPY that had interest rates of near 0% and buying the USD with interest rates of near 5%. So, you are paying a near 0% interest rate per year towards people you owed JPY, but receiving a 5% interest rate per year from your ownership of USD. If, on a relative basis, the JPY appreciates (gets more expensive) by 5% or more per year, you would lose money as this would wipe out your gains from the interest rate differential. If the currency moves the other way, with JPY getting cheaper relative to USD, you could stand to make a lot of money this way. If the currencies remain flat, on a relative basis, you would be pocketing the 5% per year interest rate differential. One of the reasons this is hard for individuals to do is that you are unlikely able to borrow at headline interest rates unless you have sizable banking relationships. In addition, there are numerous risks, including currency exchange rate movements (one currency getting cheaper or more expensive relative to the other), interest rate changes (thus removing the positive interest rate differential you are gaining), among others.
Well, anyone investing in them would take a massive hit. This includes everyday people, businesses, and to a larger extent, the US government.

There's several ideas why. A child's jaw isn't large enough to fit a full set of permanent teeth. Also, baby teeth may serve as kind of a placeholder so that there will be enough space on the jaw for the permanent teeth to grow in. The baby teeth save the spot of its corresponding permanent tooth until it's developed enough to replace it. Children that lose a baby tooth early might experience problems with overcrowding of their permanent teeth.
Geography. Turkey controls the Bosphorus strait, splitting the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. During the Cold War, control of that strait was absolutely vital. The USSR's navy was bottled up for large portions of the year when the winter would freeze their other ports up. Only the ports in the Black Sea remain ice free 100% of the year. It was also very close to Russia, and the US placed several nukes in Turkey until the Cuban missile crisis.
 URL_0  Apparently yellow has been repeatedly been used to refer to Asia as a whole since the 400s BCE (Greco-Persian Wars, when "Persia" encompassed a bunch of different peoples). It could be similar to how society shifts it's perception of color (i.e. red hair is more orange to us today, or that the ocean was "wine colored" in Homer's Odyssey). The world yellow is also etymologically close to gold, and I would say that you could accurately describe some Eastern Mediterranean skin tones as "golden." Edit: New source of info and we're back to square one. "Applied to Asiatics since 1787, though the first recorded reference is to Turkish words for inhabitants of India."  URL_1

Ok, lets take your questions one at a time: It's not expressly allowed, but many states have "built it in" or actually codified it into their laws. Illinois for example is blatantly gerrymandered, but there is nothing we can do about it, because the law makers made a law that says they get to do it, which especially in Illinois' case, leads to the crazy corruption you correctly assumed would accompany the practice. It's not obviously bad from the view point of the law makers, who do it to ensure an easier path to office for members of their party. If the repubs here drew the map, it would look vastly different than how it is now, and if a computer drew the map, it would be a 3rd version. The ensuring that your political party optimizes the possible number of votes in their district is the good of it, for them. There is no good for the people, you are overlooking, when it comes to gerrymandering. Can it be changed? That is a state by state question. I believe there are only a handful of states that currently draw their districts by "impartial" computer programing. And I say that, because the program is only as fair as the math used to create it, and it keeps evolving. [I submitted this post]( URL_0 ) about fixing the map in Illinois, specifically, with a computer program. The links within can show you any state you want, how it is versus how the computer would do it, and you can see for yourself - given what the law makers think is fair, versus what raw numbers think is fair. Hope this helped. EDIT: Thank you /u/NotABoxSocial! I will pass along the kindness.
 > I mean let's say you have negative 5 sets of negative 10 apples. This means you actually have 50 apples? Yes - sort of. It's important to be clear about what negative means though in order for the example to make sense. In physics, this part is really easy to conceptualize because when you're dealing with vectors (velocity, for instance), a negative value just means a positive value in the opposite direction. In your sets/apples example though, we need to figure out how that would apply. What does it mean to have a set of negative 10 apples? It would mean that you're in debt 10 apples. So if somebody gives you negative 10 apples, they're taking 10 apples away from you. It's the exact opposite of them giving you *positive* 10 apples, which would be them simply giving you 10 apples. What about a negative set? Same thing applies. If somebody gives you a negative set of something, they're taking a set away from you. If they give you negative 5 sets of something, they're taking away 5 sets of that something from you. So what if I give you negative 5 sets of negative 10 apples? That means I'm actually taking 5 sets of negative 10 apples from you. Another way to say that would be I'm having you give me 5 sets of negative 10 apples. And since giving somebody a set of negative 10 apples is the same thing as taking 10 apples from them, **by giving you negative 5 sets of negative 10 apples, I am essentially giving you 50 apples.**
Compare these two things: In the next sentence, find the number of all the words that are "dog". "The dog in the field is a black dog." You found word 2 and word 9. But you probably had to read the whole sentence and count carefully. Using the following information, tell me which words are "dog" black: word 8 dog: word 2, word 9 field: word 5 See, I did the extra work of reading the sentence and storing where the words are. I also eliminated the "useless" words like "the" and "in". And then I stored it in alphabetical order so you could look up anything really fast. Google does something similar. It has a set of information that includes things like: dog:  URL_1 ,  URL_2 ,  URL_0  So when you search for "dog" it just goes and looks it up and reports it as fast as it can. On your computer when you search for "dog" it goes and reads all your documents. (except for when you have an indexing service, then it's working more like google, and then it's usually pretty quick).
The dominant theory regarding adhd is that its caused by a lack of dopamine in the brain.

Because your blood sugar drops and you get hypoglycemic which causes the nausea or the puky feeling. a simpler way to explain this- When have been hungry for a while our bodies start slowing down to preserve nutrition. This affects blood circulation to put it simply which is why some of us feel light headed, dizzy,etc. Edit 2- another reason for nausea is the acid produced in the stomach. Excessive acid on an empty stomach can cause nausea/ vomiting as well. Edit 3- Before my inbox explodes, I would like to say I don't think Hypoglycemia is the only cause here. It's different things for different people as I explained above. We all have different tolerances towards hunger. This is not a thesis on starvation. Edit 4- link in my post below in the thread Edit 5- RIP my inbox. Not all of these things will happen if you've skipped a meal. It's different for different folks. Some of us have blood sugar issues and some don't. A person in this thread got a stroke after starving for nearly a week. So, I am not saying if you skip a meal your body will completely shut down. There are different stages of hunger. Edit- language
Many of the petitions they haven't responded to are related to law enforcement or diplomatic issues. It's often considered inappropriate for elected officials to intervene directly in law enforcement issues, because this can be perceived as the government inappropriately favoring or disfavoring individuals for political reasons. Answering questions on diplomatic issues, meanwhile, could compromise relationships or bargaining positions with other countries.

Women and girls are ensnared in sex trafficking in a variety of ways. Some are lured with offers of legitimate and legal work as shop assistants or waitresses. Others are promised marriage, educational opportunities and a better life. Still others are sold into trafficking by boyfriends, friends, neighbors or even parents. Trafficking victims often pass among multiple traffickers, moving further and further from their home countries. Women often travel through multiple countries before ending at their final destination. For example, a woman from the Ukraine may be sold to a human trafficker in Turkey, who then passes her on to a trafficker in Thailand. Along the way she becomes confused and disoriented. Typically, once in the custody of traffickers, a victim's passport and official papers are confiscated and held. Victims are told they are in the destination country illegally, which increases victims' dependence on their traffickers. Victims are often kept in captivity and also trapped into debt bondage, whereby they are obliged to pay back large recruitment and transportation fees before being released from their traffickers. Many victims report being charged additional fines or fees while under bondage, requiring them to work longer to pay off their debts.
Absolutely anything, theoretically. In practice, it completely depends on the relationship between the two governments. Libya has gotten away with shooting a British cop dead in London on the grounds the person doing the shooting was inside the embassy at the time, and the British cops had no right to search the place or interview anyone. On the other hand a Russian diplomat here in Canada killed someone while driving drunk some years ago. We couldn't prosecute him, but the Russian government recalled the guy and charged him under Russian law. I'd be willing to bet it would have been much more pleasant for him to have waived immunity, but so it goes.

This question is so big I almost don't know where to begin. To start we have to explain why private prisons boomed in the US and why we actually have mass incarceration. In the 70's the US started their campaign The War On Drugs. Since then our prison population has sky rocketed. In the 80's local, state, and federal governments could no longer afford the rising costs of the prison boom. Because of this in the 80's we also saw the beginning of a Private Prison boom across the US. Why does it matter that we have private prisons? Corporations have fiduciary duty to be profitable for their share holders. So now we have prisons that do not care about rehabilitation, they only care about incarceration. The more prisoners they can warehouse in a single prison, the more money they make. The less "amenities" the prison offers to the prisoners, the more money the prison makes. And when people do get out, or die inside the prison then they need to be replaced to maximize profits. Ok, so now we have a very basic view of why we have mass incarceration. Why is it so bad? Well the main driver of mass incarceration has been the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs was historically started by Richard Nixon as a way to oppress "The Anti-War Left and black people." And it worked. Since the beginning of the war on drugs we have seen drug laws that disproportionately target poor people. I will leave this [clip]( URL_0 ) of Eugene Jarecki's Documentary *The House I Live In* Here. If you have not seen the whole documentary I suggest that you do. Didn't all these people commit crimes? Yes, but because of the war on drugs we tailored our laws not to rehabilitate those in need of medical care, but instead chose to incarcerate them for generations. Do you have any idea what it does to the poor communities to have their fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, etc... ripped out of their lives for decades? To answer your original question. It has cost the taxpayers billions in keeping a failed system (the war on drugs) afloat in order to keep our prisons full. We have basically destroyed generations of families and communities for the profit of these prisons. Mass incarceration has bred hatred, mistrust, abuse of power, oppression, and division. It has mimicked slavery and fostered racism within our legal system. It is destructive and disgusting at its core.
I think it can be summed up by a conversation I had last week with one of my customers who used to work the same job as me 20 years ago. Me: The problem is they start our pay out so low in comparison to other companies, but the benefits are amazing man. Him: How much are they starting you at? Me: $40,000 a year. Him: Damn that's the same pay they started me at 20 years ago. So, considering inflation, the rising cost of blah blah blah, and the ever increasing need for the world to consume, 40k isn't the same as 40k 20 years ago.

Myself and the other mods are working on an edited version of [The Five-Year-Old's Guide to the Galaxy]( URL_0 ) to hopefully be finished sometime this spring. We're trying to focus more on an adult/Reddit-age audience and take some of the more advanced questions a five-year-old wouldn't be interested in. I would personally love to see a version of the Guide geared more towards kids and parents (as it seems this project will be). It would be great to have some community members create something as well. Hope you guys have great success! Remember to post nominations for the guide (any quality post on an interesting topic would be great) [here.]( URL_1 )
Cloud Imperium Game's Star Citizen is a game in ongoing development. It's being built as a series of modules that will connect together over time. The current modules are: * **Arc Corp**- a city based social hub. * **Arena Commander**- an arcade style 'horde mode', treated as a game within the game. * **Crusader**- a single star system that players can fly around in, explore stations on foot, take on basic mission and fight each other. Pending modules are: * **Persistent Universe**- the full MMO experience. Arc Corp and Crusader will integrated with other planetary systems into one cohesive galaxy. * **Squadron 42**- A single player story that is set as a prequel to the events of the PU. * **Star Marine**- An FPS multiplayer game within the game. * Also in development are more ships, different career choices (such as mining, trading, and salvage), and procedurally generated planets. Some of the criticisms and rebuttals: * **Feature creep**- the game has massively exceed the funding raised on the original Kickstarter campaign, and the scope of the has changed, leading some to feel that the game is not now the one they were promised. CIG's response is that when they had $6m, they were going to make a $6m game. Now that they have $100m they're making a $100m game. * **Delays**- Several features and modules have slipped previously promised dates. CIG have been a lot more cautious of late about making promises, but some are upset that things aren't going as fast as they were told it would be. The rebuttal here is that delays are a common issue with a lot of games in development, so it should be no surprise that CIG is no exception. * **Concept Sales**- ('pre-ordering' a ship before it has been built)- this has faced several criticisms: that CIG should finish ships before making new ones, that ships change from concept to completion, and that there's no guarantee that the ships will ever be anything more than 'jpegs'. The first concern is answered with the fact that the Concept Artists don't build the ships, there are several teams working in parallel on different stages of each ship's progress. The response to second and thirds concerns is telling people to wait. There is no requirement to by concept ships, so If you're not sure you're going to like the finished product, don't buy it until you know what it's going to be. Edit: added Star Marine

When immigrants come to the USA and are looking to start a new business they often go to the US department of labor and ask about trending industries and see what areas are projected to be a growth market. When for political reasons or whatever you get a large spike of immigrants from a specific country. They then all show up at the same time and all of them ask what business are trending and they all get the same answer. So now you have a large population from a specific region all working the same type of business. After a while new immigrants come over and they want to find work, if they are lucky enough a cousin or something came over before them and is now a business owner. So they go work with their family members. The first immigrant who opened the business now has a bunch of family members working for them and might want to expand. Maybe try and get a store for their son or nephew to run for themselves. Once you already have a successful franchise with a company you can get a large cut on the franchise fees for opening up a second location compared to opening up the first. Also you have been doing this for a while so you now know what works and what doesn't and can improve your chances for the second branch being successful.
Reaction to stress. Blood is pulled from regions like stomach to support run or fight response (more blood to muscles and brain)
I know everyone has already basically answered this, but I want to anyway. It was primarily because of cost. Every additional chip significantly increased the 'cost of goods sold', adding more financial risk if the game failed, and lowering profits. Cost and size are why Sony went with CDs for playstation. A single CD was huge and cost like 50 cents to a dollar at the time, a cartridge was something like $15. My understanding is that Sony would also refund you for unsold copies, Nintendo wouldn't. On the flip side carts were super fast to load, CDs were extremely slow, Nintendo bet on the small and fast, thus no FMVs. Address space doesn't seem to be an issue. From what I've read it uses 32 bit addressing for data in memory and for loading from the cartridge. Since the biggest games were 64MB I could just assume its uses 32 bit for loading (though 26 bit would be exactly enough). For those who still care, here's how I usually explain computer addressing (I think it's a pretty clear way). Think of each of your fingers the as bit in a computer processor, thus representing a 10 bit computer. Each individual way of arranging your fingers open and closed represents a single address that you can read or write data from. Your fingers can be arranged in 1024 (2 to the power 10) different ways so you can read and write from 1024 address. A 16 bit computer can touch 2^16 (64k) addresses, 32 bit can touch 2^32 (4 billion). Of course schemes exist to use more 'address space' than there are bits, but they require extra computation time, and in any case clearly weren't necessary on the n64 (though they were on the original 8 bit NES for example).

I work in one actually... well not one of the bank buildings, but one of the skyscrapers anyway. The bank may own the building but they use little if any of it. It's office space for rent mainly. I work for a company that only has about 15 employees, and we rent a bit of room on one floor in our building. All kinds of companies are operating out of them. Go check out their directories sometimes, it's full of companies.
What would happen to the Earth? Probably nothing. If you made an instantaneous hole through the Earth and it wasn't being supported by anything, gravity would cause the solid core to fill the space immediately. The mantle will also fill in immediately. It would be like asking what would happen if you drilled a hole in the ocean. There might be a small earthquake that we can detect but that's about it. I'm not sure what will happen to the crust. Either you would have a very deep hole with a lava plug at the bottom, or a volcano. The earth has thousands of them, and the man made ones will probably be smaller than most, as it won't be over a hot spot or along a plate boundary. It would probably leak lava for a few days or weeks then stop and become extinct. Nothing that would affect very many people. If you could some how shield your hole to keep it form collapsing, nothing would still happen. The hole is too small and earth is too big. Gravity has to do with the mass of the planet, and the mass wouldn't change, or change by much, depending on what you did with the material in the hole, piled it up or simply disappeared it. The magnetic field also wouldn't be affected. Your hole is too small. If you had a hole a couple hundred miles across, you might get some of the apocalyptic effects you are looking for, but for a smaller hole, even one a mile wide, nothing exciting would happen.
The game knows where you are, but the AI doesn't. The AI has some information about its surroundings, but the game engine does not tell the AI where you are (unless it is cheating to make it more difficult). so the AI actually has to look and try and find you normally, using the information it actually gets from the game engine. Not all parts of a video game (or any program) has access to all other parts. The part that handles the AI is distinct from the part that handles the graphics which is distinct from the part that handles player controls. The AI part can't access information it does not own.
They do because basically they have more surface. Cold can reach the bridge from every side, where with roads they can only reach it from one side because there is ground in the way.
There are two types of Queens, Queen Regnant and Queen Consort. Queen Regnant inherits the position from the previous monarch, and is the ruling head of state Queen Consort is the wife of the current monarch and has no official role within the state. There is no equivalent King Consort, so Philip could only be Prince Consort instead. Ruling Queens have avoided naming their partner as King to avoid appearing weaker or not in charge. The only occasion where a Queen Regnants husband was styled King was as a result of the glorious revolution when Mary replaced her deposed father on condition that her husband be allowed to rule jointly with her
Edit 4: All the way at the top so you can read it first. Disclaimer: I am not a ~~doctor nor chiropractor~~ medical professional. While I do have some medical experience, I am in no way qualified to provide medical advice. I am simply sharing what training I've received and my personal experiences either with customers or what I've felt myself. I am doing this of my own free will at the low low price of... wait for it.. free. Yes that was a salesman joke. Now all comments I've expressed are opinionated. Please research this topic yourself before purchasing a mattress. Trust but verify. I currently work at a Colorado based Mattress Store. While you don't need a mattress or a pillow, it does wonders for hip, neck, back, and shoulder pains. A properly fitted mattress provides about 2/3rds of your support. The mattress in conjunction with the pillow provides the remaining 1/3rd. I feel that this support is necessary IF you want the best nights rest possible. You can still sleep without it but not optimally. The way it was explained in my training is as follows. A mattress that is actually fitted to your sleeping habits and body, reduces how much your muscles have to work throughout the night to maintain the natural S curve of your spine. If your muscles work hard throughout the night maintaining this position you tend to wake up with a tense back and/or back pain. The part the pillow plays is also quite important. An improperly fitted pillow typically causes neck pain due to similar reasons. The neck muscles work and are stretched throughout the night from the lack of support. Please note that this a very general statement and that every person is different as well as the mattress they sleep on. Many people will say that they sleep absolutely amazing on their current mattress that is 40 years old (no exaggeration, true story). However, I used to think that Motorola Razr was the best phone ever. Then I tried something new, the Samsung Note. To be clear, my point is that just because you feel something is the best you've ever experienced doesn't mean you can't experience something better. Bonus (A few general mattress rules) : If you are a side sleeper try to avoid firm mattresses. They place a lot of pressure on your shoulders and hips with very little give. This leads to more tossing and turning throughout the night (even if you aren't completely awake/aware). Adjustable bases, sometimes called hospital beds, are used in hospitals for a reason. They reduce pressure on your body by forming a S curve to help match your spine's curve. Also, they raise your feet above your heart causing increased blood flow to facilitate healing. Why do you think doctors tell you to keep certain injuries elevated? In regards to pillows, most stomach sleepers need a thin pillow. Side sleepers often need the thickest. The reason for that relates to your shoulders. The pillow needs to be about as thick as the distance from your neck to the edge of your shoulder so that the neck is in line with spine. Back sleepers are often needing something in the middle. Although almost every customer claims to need the fluffiest fluffernugget of a pillow we have. Very few of them will listen otherwise. So we sell it to them. The customer is always right. No matter how ridiculously wrong they are. Edit 1: A lot of people have asked about the best pillow for someone who switches between their stomach and side throughout the night. There isn't a specific pillow or really even a best one. What works for me may not work for you. However this is what I personally do: What worked for me, and **might** work for you is this. I purchased a thin pillow that I was comfortable with on my stomach. Now, most side sleepers end up having an arm underneath the pillow essentially "increasing" the thickness of the pillow to match a so called side sleeper pillow. This worked for me. My arm made up for the missing padding. Again, this is what is good for me. Edit 2: There has been a fair amount of skepticism regarding the increased blood flow portion of this comment. The medical field is slightly outside my area of knowledge. However, while I am not currently retracting this statement, I am going to research a little more in depth. Hopefully I come back with a more satisfactory explanation. Edit 3: Wow. Um. Gold. Huh. I really appreciate that! Truly! *obligatory first gold comment followed by lame pun* Edit 5: There's been a lot more interest on this subject than I expected. I've answered most of the questions at least once, some more. If I haven't addressed yours, the answer may be in another comment. Tonight however, I'm turning in. I may be able to answer some tomorrow morning. Past that, I feel like the subject was been pretty well exhausted. I do wish I every a excellent night's rest! Good night! Edit 6: Editing the edit. I get it, a lot of people don't like chiropractors.
There are several different types of touchscreens. The two that you're probably most familiar with are resistive and capacitive. Resistive touchscreens, which are used in Nintendo's products and pre-iPhone PDAs and smartphones have flexible plastic screens. When you push on the screen, you squeeze multiple layers together and this completes an electric circuit. Most modern smartphones use capacitive touchscreens. These touchscreens are made of glass. When you touch the screen with your hand, you distort the electric field in the screen and it can measure where that change took place. Insulators, like plastic or most fibers, won't distort the field so the screen won't recognize them. "Smartphone gloves" have metal fibers woven into the fingertips to make the screen notice them.
To understand why the protests are happening, you need to understand some of the history of Turkey as a nation, and the Ottoman Empire before it. To understand the Ottoman Empire, you need to understand the Islamic concept of a caliphate. So, here goes: In the Islamic world, there has always been the concept of a "caliph," which in Arabic means "successor"– a successor to Muhammad. Sometimes, people think of a caliph like a "Muslim Pope," which isn't really accurate. The concept of a caliphate and a caliph isn't tied to any particular region. Instead, the idea is that the Caliph represents all Muslims, and has the authority to speak for them. In the most basic terms, it's a symbol of where power in the Islamic world rests at any given time. Here's where the Ottoman Empire comes in. As one of the most powerful states in the world for a few centuries, it was natural that the Caliphate was based in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, for most of that time. It's for this reason that the Ottoman Empire is often considered the fourth (and last) caliphate. Now comes Turkey. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and the war's victors were already circling like vultures, ready to pick apart Ottoman territory. However, there was a guy named Mustafa Kemal (or Ataturk, meaning father of all Turks)– he is basically the George Washington of Turkey, and it was with his leadership that Turkey managed to survive as a single state. Here's the catch: Ataturk also established a strong tradition of secularism in the Turkish state, and he *abolished the caliphate.* Ataturk had seen how a reliance on Islamic thought had stifled the technological advancement of the once-great Ottoman Empire. He felt that to adequately "westernize" Turkey, he had to do away with the state religion. This choice upset a lot of people, and still does. The current reigning party in Turkey comes from strongly Islamic roots, which also rubs people the wrong way– it seems to fly in the face of Ataturk's memory. Much of Turkish political history since then can be viewed as the struggle between Western secularism and the Islamic thought of the Ottomans. Given everything I've just told you, it should make a lot more sense why people got so mad about the bulldozing of a park to put up a replica Ottoman barracks– a symbol of Islamic military might. True, there was also a shopping mall, but ask any Turk, and they will tell you: the protests are about much more than a shopping mall. They are about the Turkish people's right to secularism, and about their right not to be swaddled in state-sponsored Islam. **tl;dr: The Ottoman Empire was Islamic, Ataturk made sure that Turkey was definitely not. The conflict is about bulldozing a public park to put up an Ottoman barracks, a symbol with strong Islamic connotations. Also, shopping malls.**
It's so companies and organizations like the Komen Foundation can line their pockets duping people into thinking they've done something towards research by using their services or buying their products because they're pink.
I don't think this is an American thing, but a relationship thing. I know plenty of American couples who would do this and plenty who wouldn't. I like to go to strip clubs / sex clubs / burlesque with my SO because neither of us gets jealous and because we both like looking at pretty naked people.
The air that exits your mouth is both at the same temperature. However there is a windchill effect. If there is no air movement your skin will heat up the surrounding air and create a warm layer of air around your body. However if there is some draft it will blow away this layer of air and replace it with colder air. The more wind there is the colder it feels. Even though your breath comes from your lungs it is still a bit colder then your skin.

Your network cable doesn't know what a byte is. It doesn't care whether you are sending 8 bits at a time, or 8000, there is no inherent notion of a byte. Ethernet, for example, operates on octets, three bits at a time, so thinking in terms of bytes is unnatural in that context. In addition, 100 bytes of data on your hard drive probably isn't 100 bytes on your network. Your data is going to be put into groups, and that group will have header data, separators, error correction, etc. That group will be put into another group, with more data, that is put into another group, with more data. All that might be compressed, making it smaller again. The 800 kilobits on your network are not the same as the 100 kilobytes on your disk.
Short answer is that the officer in question wasn't charged with a crime. Ignorance of the law is not a defense to criminal charges, which is what people normally mean when they say ignorance of the law is no excuse (and that is, more or less, true). The Heien ruling wasn't about any alleged criminal behavior on the part of the officer, it was about whether a stop was constitutional or not. The standard for a constitutional stop is not the same as the standard for criminal behavior. An officer doesn't need to know you've broken the law to stop you, an officer needs to have a reasonable belief that you've broken the law to stop you. In the Heien case, the vague language of the NC law made the officer's mistaken understanding reasonable. This is, by the way, in keeping with years of Supreme Court precedent. For a police officer to violate your rights they need to know that they are doing so (or at least a reasonable officer would know that their actions violated your rights). Constitutional violations are not the same as criminal acts and are judged according to a different standard.
"Social justice warrior" is a term used to describe someone who is purposely looking to be offended by something, or who wants to make an issue where none exists. Someone who legitimately cares about (and is properly informed about) social issues is not referred to as a warrior, but instead as perhaps an "advocate," "activist," or "concerned citizen." The term warrior is more aggressive, and is used to someone who relentlessly pursues a false agenda. Most SJWs don't even actually care about the issues they bring up, but rather are trying to get social attention for being "progressive."
Fear. People make up stories to comfort themselves. Or each other. Once we exist we want to continue to exist because those of us without that drive, didn't survive.
Would you elaborate on how they are "Taliban-like". I mean... they have an unpopular view of the world, but that is protected by the First Amendment. They haven't (to my knowledge) used violence or the threat of violence as a political tool in decades (which is the definition of a terrorist). So they don't really qualify. Also recall that the KKK is basically toothless at this point. They aren't worth the governments time.
Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another. First, water has high heat capacity. That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy. So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS. The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it. Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster. Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer. For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water. Should go alot faster in the water. tl;dr - Water has more energy in a smaller space and transfers that energy much faster.
The credit card company runs the infrastructure that makes credit card transactions possible. Whether a charge is made with a magnetic reader, a web page, a telephone call, or a paper impression, someone has to keep track of all that data, and let the merchant, the customer, and the banks know who owes whom what. They make money by charging a fee for each transaction. The bank's role is to put up the money that backs the transaction. They make money by charging annual fees, late fees, and interest.
Most developing countries at one point or another were colonized by Europeans. As they became independent and modernized, they equated Western things with affluence and power. I would also guess that wearing a suit gets Europeans to take you more seriously than if you were wearing what is the equivalent of a dress to them. For example, in East Asia, men will nearly always wear suits at formal functions while women can still wear traditional wear. Look at North Korean military parades and look at what the crowd is wearing. And that's in a country with a strictly Anti Western policy.
Because the pay day loans still operate within the parameters of the law, such as paying taxes on the loans, paying for a business license and not physically harming the people who owe them money, while sharks purposefully choose to engage in that illegal activity by shirking tax and licensing responsibilities and physically harming their clients who do not pay up.
Yes they remove some of the surrounding tissue, sometimes the entire organ just to be safe. Still some times the organ is important and it has to be done carefully so less tissue is removed.
They built them in air, not underwater. First they blocked off the water around where they were going to dig and build using what are called Cofferdams or Caissons made of pile driven wood or stone and pumped out by bucket, dug the foundation and built to the water line and then removed the temporary structure. Pressurized versions are relatively new but can go deeper but the original idea is almost 2 millennia old and would have been used for major bridges during that time.
"  > It is, and it will just become more feasible as technology grows. The real question is whether it's politically acceptable, since it would require some radical changes.  > Take the federal budget of $3.45 trillion. We can eliminate social security ($800B), medicare/medicaid ($750B), welfare ($400B), and probably some defense and other miscellaneous cuts ($200B).  > This leaves us with a federal budget of $1.3 trillion or so.  > We can replace the medical programs with universal healthcare, since it would be more efficient to do it this way than to have people buy insurance and all. Most other countries spend around $3000 per citizen, or around 10% of GDP, depending which figure you take, you'll get different numbers. If you take the $3000 figure, you can spend around $1 trillion for UHC, but if you go by GDP, you're more likely to spend closer to $1.5 trillion. I'll use 1.3 trillion for the sake of estimate. This means we have federal outlays of $2.6 trillion (to be fair, states will cut their programs too, so you'd save a lot there).  > next phase, a tax code change. Eliminate the entire income and payroll tax code. Replace it with about a 40% flat tax on all earned income. No loopholes, no deductions, no nothing. Well, ok, since capital gains go into that, in order to make the 40% tax more acceptable, we can allow for a 40% capital loss deduction to make the gambling "fair", but yeah, other than that. Same with corporate rates, jack them up to 40% to prevent abuse (only profit taxed, obviously).  >  URL_0   > Going by that calculator, assuming 230 million adults eligible, 2.6 trillion in other outlays, and using those numbers (which, looking up the stats themselves, are accurate), the numbers add up.

You'd get taxed on about $8400 of that, but get a $15k UBI. So you'd make a total of $27,600.  > Say you make around the household median income of $52,000 a year. That's $20,800 in taxes, but it would only be $5,800 after UBI, or 11.2% in effect.  > Say you make $1,000,000 a year. You get taxed for $400,000, but get the same $15,000. So you'd end up with a 38.5% tax rate.

I'll admit, this is kind of the rough, perfect world numbers, maybe the real numbers would be different somehow due to finding ways to avoid taxes, etc., or maybe more outlays than I'm accounting for, but you can get the gist of it. Some people fear capital flight with taxes those high, but considering how a lot of other countries have effective rates in the 30-40% range and don't have problems, I don't see a problem. You still will have state and local taxes, but I'd see these getting cut since they'd no longer need safety nets themselves.

I think the assumption is supposed to be that the "bad guy" has found a way of either directly accessing the [EAS]( URL_0 ), or he's found a way of duplicating it.
A lot of people in St. Croix don't have them, because they have to be shipped in from elsewhere, making them expensive, because they blow off and get damaged in storms, making them a hazard, and because they get in the way of the opening and closing of the window louvers which are the main ventilation of most homes (air conditioning is considered a luxury, not a given).
Gallup was around then, and did a [survey]( URL_0 ) among Americans. Although not a majority, more favored preventing Japanese-Americans from returning after WW2 than did those allowing return.

It's been a long time since it came out and sequels made a long time after the originals tend not to do all that well. (Sin City  &  300 are notable examples). Another crowd-funded movie, Veronica Mars, did quite poorly at the box office despite a lot of hype. While Super Troopers did quite well and has a cult-following, it never reached anything compared to a movie like Anchorman. Another thing to consider is the cast. None of them are a huge draw that are essential to comedies. The likes of Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller, Kevin Hart or Steve Carrell will put bums on seats based on their names alone. Super Troopers has nobody like that. All in all, there's a lot of risk to consider.

The (relatively) short version: Banks found ways to lend money to people to purchase homes who would have, in the past, been considered to risky to lend to by spreading the risk around to other investors. This fed a housing bubble because there was a huge growth in demand for homes and people bought in hoping the price of real estate would keep rising. Obviously, it didn't, and when real estate markets crashed a lot of big banks found themselves with a lot of mortgages that were never going to get paid off. This threatened to shut down the financial sector. When banks stop lending economic activity slows massively. While bank bailouts averted a complete credit freeze and collapse of the financial sector, the crisis still led to a massive recession.
Airplanes do not load that way, nor do they load for efficiency. Airplanes load in the way that is the most financial advantageous to the airline (and this will vary between airlines). They give the best (first) loading to the customers they are making the most money from as an incentive to buy tickets like that and as a benefit of such. They have done endless, endless research on this, and in the end, its all about the money, thats how they load. Thats how they should load. They are a business, they act in their best business interest and for airlines, its all about maximizing profit on each passenger
This comment is probably too late to help anyone else but hopefully you, the OP, will read it. Japan has been through a lot of cultural shift in the past two centuries due to the west and it basically boils down to refusing to do what others want them to do. Background to help you understand. --- For a long time Japan was a closed nation. They did eventually open the borders for trade because A) the west wanted to trade, B) they wouldn't take no for an answer and C) the superior technology allowed the west win battles. Not all of Japan was against this but the majority was until it swung around to those opposing it being the minority. The west brought their customs over which quickly displaced a lot of native ones. Where as in traditional Japanese society the businessman is the lowest social class, even lower than the farmers, he was higher in western standards. It was now undignified for women to to top less working in the fields or in the fields at all, traditional clothes were disrespectful and the Western suit became more and more prevalent. Side point. One of these customs was underwear, especially ~sexy~ underwear. Regular woman couldn't afford underwear and only those that had money could. One of those that could were high class prostitutes which is where the interest with panties come from, because they were a sexual thing. Western values which were still deeply tied to religion said anything sexual was bad which is where censored porn comes from. Slowly Japanese culture was eroded as western norms took over. Now Japan has always had a sense of superiority that can still be seen to this day with the dislike of outsiders. The end of WWII with them losing took them down a notch and stuck deep in the hearts of the people. Now the US did help rebuild the country and yet again their culture was being worn away by foreigners. The working very hard to do the best you can was instilled after WWII as a way to rebuild the country by Americans. All along the way the people have fought back against the invading cultures. --- Now back to the main point. Japan has always been a fishing nation, relying on it because there's very little arable land, and whaling is, to an extent, just large fishing. The refusal to stop whaling is a massive "fuck you, I won't do what you tell me" to the world. For centuries the Japanese have basically been told that their culture was wrong and this is how you should do things and this is a protest on a national level effectively. Side point. If you read the background this is also why porn is censored, they were already forced to adopt the culture of sexuality=wrong and they refuse to change it again just because the west now deem it acceptable. --- Edit. While just a film and should be treat lightly you can actually see a lot of this in the film The Last Samurai.
Back during World War II some regulations were put in place regarding wages and salaries. But the short version is that a lot of companies over time started offering health insurance as part of the benefits package, essentially to pay workers more without actually increasing wages or salaries. Over time this became more and more the system, and now most people in the US get their healthcare from their job. Now, this doesn't have all negative consequences. For instance, the reason people will still say: "The United States has the best health care in the world, if you have insurance" is because when you're on the company policy, in many cases when you get a heart-attack you're treated just the same as if your CEO had a heart attack. Flown to Seattle, put in a fancy hospital with top-rate doctors and surgeons. etc. And while the "*if you have insurance* caveat seems like a real catch, it's actually not so horrible. The "chronically" uninsured in the country only constituted about 12 million people in the country (pre-Obamacare). But anyway - one of the bad parts of this system is that it *separates payer of cost from receiver of services.* It's really not even this system specifically, but the *"full-coverage"* style of the insurance that's common to the system. We now have an ingrained 3-party payment system for our Healthcare. It used to be that you go to the Dr. Office with a spranged ankle, and he says: *"That's a spranged ankle. Stay off it for 2 weeks."* You pay him $50 and you go on your way. But the Doctor is worried about being sued if it was something worse than a sprang, so he says: *"I think it's just a sprang, but I'd like to do an MRI."* MRI's are covered by your insurance, so you say: "Sure!" and go get an MRI. It doesn't cost you any extra. And then every doctor and every patient does this, and so insurance rates go up. Rinse, lather, repeat. It doesn't change how much you pay if you get no medical treatment or open-heart surgery. Your doctor doesn't gain or lose customers for what he charges, because that's paid by the insurance company. Your insurance company just sees you as one part of a company, so it doesn't target or charge you specifically. The end result is that nobody has any direct incentive to be efficient about medical services, or demand lower rates. It is very much worth noting that Lasik eye surgery, and cosmetic surgery, are not covered by most any form of insurance. And they're the only medical procedures to *drop* drastically in price over the last two decades. If you want medical costs to go down in a free market, you need to make sure that the signals money sends out get received by the actors making the decisions. Higher deductibles and less-full coverage would make be cognizant, discriminating shoppers for the services, and you'd see prices drop as a result. At the moment there is no competition or incentive to reduce costs by anybody.
I can answer the first part of this question. Windows has two fullscreen modes: borderless window and dedicated. Older games generally used dedicated fullscreen because it gives full control of the screen to the game. When resources were significantly lower (power of the GPU if there even was a GPU), having complete control helped squeeze out every little bit of power you could. Switching out of the game via alt-tab will force the game to lose control of the screen and give it back to Windows. This can cause flickering, screen resizing, and in some cases (such as Source games) crash. Borderless windows are completely different. They are as you expect, simply a window within Windows that has the chrome (title bar, exit button, borders) removed. This means that to tab out of a game, you don't need to do anything fancy or invasive since the game is just another window. This allows Windows to keep control of the screen which makes your game have a little less available to it in terms of resources but since GPUs are so damn powerful these days (even Intel HD chips are noteworthy) it's not really an issue. The biggest disadvantage in using borderless windows is that you cannot enable true vsync, you must rely on Windows' ability to properly sync output with your screen's refresh rate to ensure no tearing occurs. Games that allow you to enable vsync even in window borderless mode simply lock the FPS to your refresh rate and hope Windows performs as intended. Edit: Some people have suggested that a possible answer to OP's original question (if we ignore borderless windows) could be a difference in DirectX 9 and 10+, where handling the switch to and from exclusive control might be automated now where in the past developers had to handle this switch manually (to varying levels of success). Another possible answer might be that the way the game manages resources could affect how it handles tabbing. Anecdotally, I will suggest that I've heard my hard disk spin up when I tab to and from some fullscreen games that might suggest that some data is being dumped to the disk which would definitely slow things down.
It makes the store feel open and less crowded, and it lets you set up displays that take advantage of the height, such as signs visible anywhere in the store. It also makes moving things with machinery like forklifts easier. Psychological experiments have shown that people don't like being in areas with low ceilings. Some airports have made use of low ceilings in places where they don't want people to linger, like the front of the check in line. edit: check in, not check out.
The way it could work is that the car manufacturer or the company that provides the AI would also provide the insurance for the car which would be factored in to the price of the car. Car owners would no longer need to purchase insurance of their own. The determination of which vehicle is at fault would work the same way. If fault fell to an AI controlled car, the AI company's insurance would pay.
You are reading this reply right now. You've never seen this particular combination of words before, yet you somehow understand my meaning anyway because I've arranged them in a way that makes sense to you. This is called reading, you're doing it. You cannot possibly store in your brain the near infinite possible arrangements of all the words you know. You are stringing together words to infer meaning on the fly. Your brain has to a degree some hard wiring for language, earned through millions of years of evolution, that makes you capable interpreting arranged letters as words, and those words fit together to form larger concepts. With these tools people can take thoughts from their own heads and put them in other people's heads. It's fucking amazing when you think about it. The reason we know this language (and reading by extension) ability is hard-wired is we see it develop independently all over the place. It's been studied extensively. When you look at people from remote areas that have had little to no contact with other civilizations, you see they've created language with mostly the same rules and constructs. When you put people together that can't directly communicate (which was common during the international slave trade), you see that they develop crude "pigin" languages, and then those pigins get more complex in the next generation to form a "creole", and those higher level languages seem to wind up operating the same way (for the most part). Groups of deaf people will independently develop their own language with each other that operations mostly the same way everyone else's language works. I'd recommend Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct for more on this. EIDT: Who to for thanks many to gold from is, yo!

A lot of times nausea is caused by your stomach being very full, not necessarily just with food but also with air. If you have a bit of soda it can make it easier to burp and release some of the gas in there which puts pressure on the top of your stomach and nerves that make you feel uncomfortably full and nauseous. Release some of that air and there is less pressure and less nausea.
there have been much talks about it. China is the leading male-female disparity country for the young generation age group. by 2012 census, there are 40 million more males than females. additionally most people in the under 30 age group are only childs as well. there already a big gap of unmarried males because of unable to find a partner, whereas almost all females in the 20-30 age group are married.
The same reason many humans generally start going gray at the temples first and then it spreads to other parts. It's because as we and the animals age, certain pigment-producing cells at the root of our hair die, and that usually starts in specific body regions first. Normally as the hair grows, those cells inject a colour into the hair, but when they eventually die off in some body regions as most people (and dogs) age, they're not there any more to inject the dye, so the growing hair becomes essentially fingernail-clipping coloured. Genetics determines when and where this happens, in the same way that it determines other hair features such as waviness or patches of colour on a cat's or cow's hide (except that's not as time-related).
At some point while you were out, the information on your credit card was copied. The attacker probably made a fake duplicate card, and then began making purchases elsewhere. Info in the magnetic stripe on cards is not encrypted, and can be easily read with a magstripe reader. The magnetic stripe contains the same information that is printed on the front of the card. Last December, a large volume of credit card information was stolen from Target - this is on the large scale. It happens on the small scale also when a local business stores customer information in an insecure fashion. I've also heard stories of dishonest cashiers or waiters who have stolen customer card information to then sell it on the internet. EDIT: Like the other replies said, definitely contact your credit card company and report the charges as fraudulent. They'll send you a new card and you won't be charged for the fraudulent purchases.
Plenty of people object to US involvement in the Middle East, including a lot of the people who live there. Russia was especially unhappy about it, but we didn't hear much about that. Also, when Russia does anything outside it's borders, it stirs a very deeply programmed American phobia that goes back to the Cold War days.
Wow, I came in here expecting an explanation. I'm quite surprised to find the answer is "nobody knows".
HOLY CRAP! A question from my industry! Yes, i worked the first FOUR years of my engineering career at a factory in rural America that produced approximately 2 million pounds of unsliced turkey deli meat per week. I still work for one of the largest producer of turkey in the world. The answer almost exclusively boils down to economics. Turkey is a lower cost protein to make than chicken (by a small margin...but feed inputs are roughly 70% of the cost of poultry and turkeys are more efficient feed converters. Every little bit counts here). On top of this turkey is incredibly seasonal. Thanksgiving, christmas, and to a lesser extent easter are when turkey producers make their money and spend the rest of the year trying not to lose it. You cant just turn on the giant industro-ag machine that is turkey production for three holidays so production must remain relatively stable year round. People dont buy whole turkeys throughout the year so producers have to get creative. Enter turkey bacon, burgers, and.....deli breast! Essentially...if you want reasonably priced thanksgiving and christmas turkeys...the industry has to find creative ways to sell it year round....the white goes to deli, dark goes to ham, bacon, and burgers. If you have any other questions i would be happy to answer! Poultry is my life! Currently working at a large cooked chicken plant (edited to remove a customer reference...don't want to get make anyone mad...i can't/won't be able to answer questions about specific customers or products) Edit to add a few other economic factors...turkey takes substantially longer to grow than chicken so contracts on pricing are easier to secure. Chicken grows in weeks...so your contract price might look great the first flock...but feed prices change rapidly and if you lock in a year contract on chicken you could be getting screwed. Also, there are higher margin outlets for chicken breast than deli meat. Restaurants dont want to serve turkey because its slow to cook...chicken is fast and with high margins...chicken breasts are incredibly popular at the meat case for grilling. If you can get it in your store, buy a raw turkey tenderloin to marinate and grill! Best cut of meat to grill bar a ribeye! Edit a second time to say thanks for the gold. If you have questions keep asking and i'll answer ALL OF THEM. NOW GO OUT THERE AND ORDER SOME TURKEY! Im headed out for a bit but keep asking. Ill answer all the questions you send me. FINAL EDIT GUYS: My fingers hurt and i need some cold cut turkey to rejuvenate. some people are getting pretty close to figuring out my identity so i've disclosed to much and am gonna stop answering questions. i am not a "heartless animal killing nazi" but i do have a family to feed and a great job i wanna keep! For the vegans/vegetarians out there i know i won't change your opinions but know we are doing the most humane and respectful processes we can. i feed this stuff to my family and eat it almost every day. if you have any turkey specific questions let me know in my private messages and i'll be glad to answer them.
Universally know as the 'sacrificial pancake' . Usually caused by haste and a pan thats not quite hot enough.
There was a fracturing of the Democratic Party between 1964 and 1992. Working class whites became disenchanted with the party's outreach towards minorities and the social programs they believed disproportionately benefitted non-whites. The old New Deal coalition fractured, with minorities, union members, and academics at odds with these mainly Southern whites. Richard Nixon capitalized on this divide in 1968, with his Southern Strategy, reaching out to the disaffected working class whites. This strategy worked well for the next 20 years, with the GOP winning all but one presidential election. The Democratic Party controlled the House for that entire time, but was afflicted by constant bickering between its factions. As the GOP is now learning, the House is a terrible place from which to communicate a national message, due to the sheer number of members and their relative extremism as compared to either the Senate or the White House.

They are open during extremely convenient hours for most businesses, and that's where the money is.
the bureaucracy is certainly a part, as is the poverty and years of unappreciated effort. Turk and JD spend ?5? years being poor nobodies who work exceptionally long hours, and then suddenly realizing that they have some autonomy and have to direct themselves, the transition from residents to doctors to senior staff is very well dramatized and really reflects the early career of physicians well. When the medicine is demonstrated, it is demonstrated accurately enough, but as brownribbon pointed out, it takes a backseat to the story telling, and so is not defaced in the name of drama. Most of medical practice is office work, not direct patient care, and scrubs captures that well. It is an office where you stand all day and deal with patients for a hurried few hours, and paper work and personalities all the rest. The roles of the different people are also very well done. While taken to comedic extremes, you really see the different functionaries in a hospital and how their roles create conflicts. Most office shows get this wrong because they don't take it seriously enough to 1 make it consistent, and 2 make it central to the character. In scrubs the vast majority of the interactions can be explained as, "it is my job description." And, those job descriptions are real.
A significant part of male pattern baldness (the type of baldness i assume your are talking about) is due to genetics and the hormone dihydrotestosterone. baldness is caused due to the sensitivity of the hair follicle to that hormone. topical treatments can reduce the effect of the hormone on a patch of hair (Propecia and Avodart) but a "cure" would require major alterations to either the production of the hormone or to the sensitivity of the follicle. either one of these would be likely to produce significant (possibly dangerous) side effects in the patient. so far no permanent treatment has made it through enough clinical trials to be considered effective and safe.
Yes, it's called chronic laryngitis. The larynx is also known as the voice box. When people smoke and drink (any alcohol, not just whiskey) they irritate the mucosal lining of the larynx, which causes inflammation/swelling. This thickens the vocal cords and causes a raspy voice.  URL_0   URL_1 
Split it in many pieces that are as independent as possible (and if you do it wrong, you can screw up massively in this step before any line of code is written). There is no way to know everything in detail in a modern operating system, or any other large software project. It is not necessary - most lines of code are for some specific function, and independent of other functions. If you program some user interface in a random system tool, you do not have to know how the operating system handles its files, for example. Even if you have to access files, you do not have to know how those are handled: the code for file handling gives you functions like "list all files in this folder" which you can call - and you don't care about the code that actually produces this list.
One part of the reason is the difference between the ability to recognise and the ability to recall. If I asked you to name all 50 US states, would you be able to do it? Maybe you could, but you'd probably take quite a while. But if I gave you a load of place names, you'd probably be able to pick out the ones which are states quite easily. Language can be similar. Someone might be able to recognise the words when they hear them, but not be able to recall them on the spot when they want to say something.

Since there is a lot of overlapping terminology I'm going to use "male" and "female" when I'm refering to sex and "man" and "woman" when refering to gender. The definitions I'm going to give for the different genders aren't set in stone and are debatable. But, it's a good entry point. Sex is a biological trait that is related to our genes and hormones. In our DNA we have what are called sex chromosomes "x" and "y". Generally XX chromosomes create a female sexed person and XY create a male sexed person. There are other combinations, sometimes with more than two. In addition, because of other genetic effects hormones can override these chromosomes and create other sex traits. Arguably male and female are the most common, but intersex people of varying sorts aren't particularly uncommon. Gender is how we as a society expect the sexes to behave in that society but also to some extent how a person wants to interact with society with regards to their sex. So, if we looked at the US in the 50's that might mean, women have long hair. Men had short hair. Men went to work. Women stayed at home with the kids. Men liked cars. Women liked cooking. Etc. etc. etc. The usage of new gender words is to try to express the feeling many people have that their gender is either more complicated or innaccurate than the default society wants to give. The different new genders express similar but somewhat distinct ideas. People who are genderfluid tend to find that they will sometimes strongly identify with certain gender roles at different times. So a person who might love to wear very masculine suits and very feminine dresses may be genderqueer. Genderqueer is someone who finds that the normal expression of gender doesn't quite capture how they feel. They don't quite see themselves as men or as women but something amalgamated. Gender neutral is someone who sees themselves as having less gendered content. Often times gender neutral, genderqueer and genderfluid are thrown around as interchangeable. They aren't exactly. But for many people they effectively are so similar and used in such a variety of ways they all end up roughly meaning "not quite men not quite women". All of this is made more complicated by the fact that liberal socities are generally trying to break down gender roles as it is. While there has been great progress compared with say, the middle ages, there is still a TON of assumed gendered behavior that just doesn't capture people's lived experiences. I'm a little hungover so let me know if I need to do any clarifying! EDIT: Just to re-iterate a point. Sex is also more complicated than a lot of people are saying. There are more sexes than simply male or female so it's not just you are born male or female. Follows is a link with some info on intersex (which are those people who are born not exactly male or not exactly female).  URL_0  EDIT 2: HOLY SHIT! Reddit gold! Thank you anonymous benefactor! This is my first ever reddit gold. I also passed the New York bar this week. It's been a good week (the reddit gold is better). I want to quickly address a few of the "biological" points that came up in this thread and why they don't really answer the question. Someone pointed out that standard female brains tend to be smaller (which for those MRA people out there has absolutely zero correlation with intelligence), men usually have more testosterone etc etc. This is true. But notice how I had to use words like "standard" and "tend" to. It is not always the case that if you take 1 woman and 1 man they will always have relative differences based on those factors. Some women have bigger brains and more testosterone than some men. This then fails the necessary 1 to 1 requirement of a definition. For example, if I said a chair has 4 legs and then showed you one with 5 legs or three legs (or none, like a rocking chair on skis), you would have to say well it's not a chair or my definition is wrong. In this instance, I think using those points may help us understand trends and tendencies (but probably not) they don't help define gender or sex. Again I want to point out that sex is something on the biological level and unless you have a habit of DNA testing all of the people you know, you won't ever meaningfully interact with a person's sex. Because you can only ever interact with a person who has been socialized you will always interact with their gender expression. These words help more than 1% of the population. And even if they only help 1% of the population, in the USA alone that is 3 million people. That is a lot of people. I admit, learning a few new words is an inconvenience and takes some processing power (you have to read my whole post). Once you've read the post. You now know the words and can't make the argument that you will be harmed by using the words. You already know them. Seriously though, the inconvenience is minuscule on a societal level to grasp new words. I also want to point out that the idea of non-binary gender is not new. Many cultures have had third and fluid genders. For example, North American Native Americans (exactly how many tribes is currently under debate) who had a concept of two spirits and had 4 different gender categories. This idea of third gender and gender non conforming is even in the kama sutra. Plato's Symposium mentions a creation myth with Male, Female and Gender Neutral characters. EDIT 3: One more clarification. The reason individual gender expression and letting an individual pick their own gender is the best solution is precisely because gender on a social level is a weak concept. As many people have accurately pointed out women can wear pents, men can have long hair etc. etc. Agreed! That's why things often associated with gender aren't defining, merely associated (in fact many of the things often thought defining of gender in our times were different in other times, Pink used to be a boys color (it was like blood and men were bloody), and in the Middle Ages in Europe women were seen as the sexual predators and men were the innocents who needed to protect themselves). Since pretty much anything associated with gender isn't a 1 to 1 it doesn't define any gender. Therefore, there is no good way to make a call as to who is or isn't a particular gender on a macro level. Therefore, the only way to accurately sort people is to just let people sort themselves.
Magnetism is nothing at all like gravity. Like not even remotely similar. - Gravity is always attractive, magnetism can be either - Gravity has point sources and can never form dipoles, magnetism only has dipoles and can never have a point source or sinks - Mass can be stationary and form a gravitational field, charge must move to form a magnetic field and can never be stationary - Gravity isn't (known to be) related to any other fundamental forces, magnetism is the other side of the electromagnetic force. You seriously could not pick two more dissimilar forces if you tried. In fact when cosmologists talk about the origin of the fundamental forces after the big bang, they talk about gravity splitting off and then everything else splitting off - it's the *least* like magnetism of them all
I don't think it's true. You can blame the British for a lot of the troubles in India (or just about any other country in the world lol) but the Caste system has existed in India for hundreds of years.
Starting tomorrow, we wouldn't have to call it "South" Korea anymore.
Most of the rest of the world doesn't mass produce English language entertainment. While foreigners can often understand English, or are use to having programs dubbed or subtitled, the US audience won't watch a foreign language production over their massive home media output. Those countries that do produce English language media do occasionally make traction in the US - *Wentworth* recently from Australia, *What we do in the Shadows* from New Zealand certainly has an international cult following, and of course many British shows are popular. I suspect the number of productions that make it in the US is about proportional to the size of those english speaking countries media industry.

Wood burns in two stages: the hydrogen stage and the carbon stage. In the hydrogen stage, hydrocarbon molecules are broken and oxidise. In the carbon stage, the carbon oxidises. The carbon stage burning is a hotter and cleaner chemical reaction than hydrogen stage burning. Charcoal is made by burning wood in the hydrogen stage (hence removing the hydrocarbons) but not allowing the carbon stage (by limiting the amount of oxygen).
Black Americans have been in something like a permanent state of identity-crisis, that will probably not abate until either: - Terms like "African-American" are accepted as fully and as un-ironically as "Polish-American" or "Irish-American", or; - Race itself becomes such a nebulous, blended, and indistinct thing that skin-color is regarded as no different from eye or hair color. In the meantime, a particular challenge for black Americans is disconnection from historic familial roots. An Irish-American family might name their kid Sean or Daniel or Molly or Colleen or Mary, with some connection to those who came before (even if those names might bear little or no resemblance to ancient Irish names and culture). Most black Americans bear family names from the slave-owners of their forbears, or arbitrary names given to freedmen. A white American man named, say, Robert DiGiacomo might go by "Bobby", and might consider himself mostly German/Scots, but he knows where his name comes from, and he knows that his father was descended from an Italian. If he wanted to, Bobby G could probably trace his ancestry back to specific people and families from any number of countries. A black man named Robert Smith might have little more than a vague idea that one of his ancestors was once owned by a man named "Smith". It is unlikely that he could reliably trace most of his family tree back further than slavery, since good records were not kept, about the lineage and ancestry of slaves. And any "deep past" records of his roots might actually refer to white parentage that abandoned or rejected their multi-racial offspring. He might not be able to able to find the specific African language, name-tradition, or region his ancestors came from, even if he tried. As a result, many Black Americans have chosen to embrace an entirely new notion of heritage and identity, based on the global infusion of African culture into a worldwide diaspora. This could include elements of Caribbean, Creole, French-colonial, and Anglo-American influences, as well as pan-African culture (and Africa is a very big place, with wildly-divergent cultures, easily as different as Irish is from Greek, or Japanese is from Indian). One example of this embrace of Black pan-culturalism is choosing or creating names that might sound exotic in any language. People who know the names of their ancestors might choose names that come from the same tradition. But when you don't know the names of your ancestors, or when you know their legal names to be "fake" names given to them by the people who bought and sold them like chattel, it's not so easy. If you know something vague of where you came from, and that you are part of a diaspora that has influences the world over, you might choose to give your child a name that reflects that uncertain melding of cultures. Indian parents might name their kids "Vijay", Swedish-Americans might name their kids "Gustav", Japanese might name their kids "Haruto", Italian-Americans might go with "Antonio", etc... But Black Americans descended from the nebulous heritage of slavery have no obvious tradition of forefathers to turn to, when it comes to naming their children, except maybe slave-names. So many choose to invent or adopt new names, as the ancients did in other cultures. Just as names like "Antonio" or "Robert" or "Seamus" were once invented and applied to children, so names like Leshawn or Taniqua are invented or adopted by people who are not without a culture, not without a heritage, just without a fixed vocabulary, due to its newness. The African diaspora has had a massive global influence on culture, but it happened in very different ways than other historically-recent diasporas. We were not around 1,000 or 10,000 years ago, when the Europeans or Africans were first inventing names. In the great re-combinator that is global cultural evolution, Black America has emerged as a new distinct cultural tradition, much as Celts and Gauls diverged and became things like Scotch, Irish and German, hundreds of years ago. The culture of "Black America", and of the African diaspora more generally, is still in its infancy. We're still in an era where people who lived under Jim Crow are alive and kicking, and the last slaves are only a few decades dead. As people with names like Kanye, Obama, and Deshawn become more prominent and influential participants in the global economy of ideas, their names will begin to sound less strange. We are seeing the emergence of a new global cultural tradition, with ethnic and historical influences that are distinct from the existing ones. Black American culture has a very troubled and difficult past, and much of it still has a troubled and difficult present, but its present is no worse than that of, say, the Irish from 150 years ago. ("How the Irish Became White" is an interesting read on the topic of historical race-identity). Black America, and the African Diaspora more generally, is still in the process of inventing itself, as a cultural identity. And that includes names. It has contributed a tremendous amount of good to the world in its early days, and there is no reason to think it won't get better. edit: wow, RIP inbox, and thanks for all the gold! **To address some of the FAQs:** - "Obama isn't a made-up name! And it's a last name!": Yes, I meant that as more people adopt it as a first name, and as more names that sound "black" come into prominence and familiarity, they will start to sounds less exotic or strange. Sorry for the ambiguity. - "I don't think anyone really calls themselves 'Irish American' or 'Polish American'. Everyone is just American." There are thousands of Irish-American, Polish-American, Italian-American, German-American clubs, all across the US. So it is definitely a thing for some people, although maybe not for you. - "I disagree with the term 'African Americans', because it's not an accurate term, or something about hyphens." You're right, it's not an accurate term. Neither is "black" or "white" (that's more like a dark-brown to pinkish spectrum). I try to use words with commonly-accepted meanings, as they are commonly understood. Unfortunately, sometimes we use short words to refer to complex or nuanced ideas such as race and ethnic identity, and it can be hard to discuss anything other than the verbiage and nomenclature itself, without adopting some kind of shorthand that someone is bound to find objectionable. - " 'Scotch' should be used for whisky and tape, not to describe people." Sorry, I stand corrected. Error left as posted, for continuity-purposes. A lot of other posters have raised a lot of very good and interesting points, and others have raised a lot of bad and long-discredited ones. I am grateful if I was able to help spark interesting discussion.
Because it will add to their misery. This is not like the forgetting that non-sufferers may experience as a result of an injury or hangover; it goes much deeper and has a shorter cycle. You can tell an Alzheimer's patient a "fact" one minute and it's gone in 30 seconds. The *truth* for advanced patients may bear absolutely no resemblance to fact, because a humane approach most often involves meeting their uncertainties with whatever words bring comfort, not pounding them with proof that they're wrong.
Lots of things. (1) The diseases had killed off vast numbers of people even in places that no Europeans visited. By the time anyone set up colonies in North America, you were already looking at the post-apocalyptic leftovers of their civilization. (2) It really wasn't that fast. You are looking at a stretch of basically 500 years. That's a long damn time by anyone's reckoning. (3) Numbers and technology did play a role. The Natives only had their own groups to replace their numbers, but the colonists had a practically limitless supply of people and resources coming over from the Old World. (4) There was no such thing as "The Native Americans." There were many hundreds of nations, bands, and tribes that encountered the Europeans at different times and places. Many native groups were also at war with each other. There was never a point at which all natives took direction from a single leader or followed a single policy. Trying to look at millions of diverse people as if they were a single Borg-like entity is a huge mistake.
Men release prolactin into their system after sex which causes them to feel tired. Although trying to convince my fiancee of that is impossible, proof or no proof.
They are very delicate and extremely hard to keep in tanks for that reason. They are mostly water with very thin membranes as their body structure. Any sharp object can rip them apart fairly easily. Of course, there are lots of larger jellies that have evolved to be more durable, or can grow big enough to withstand damage (like the Stygiomedusa gigantea, or the larger fried egg jellyfish specimens). But the vast majority are small and mostly helpless, except for their unique stinging cells, but that doesn't affect their ability to survive in a tank. In their natural environment, they usually just float freely with the currents in the open ocean, so there's nothing for them to bump up against (except predators). They aren't strong swimmers either, so they can get stranded or trapped easily if the current washes them onto the shore or pushes them into a confined area. In order to most closely replicate their natural environment, jellies need tanks with rounded edges to keep from getting stuck in corners, a gentle current to propel them around the tank, and a small amount of food suspended in the water. They have very specific requirements for temperature and water pH, but I don't know those details, you could probably find them on an aquarist website, though. No gravel since they could scrape against the grains and tear up their membranes. No plants since they could get stuck in the leaves. I don't think the jellyfish stings would be good for the plant either, but maybe it would be fine. Anyway, there ya go! If you want to know more just look up a jellyfish keeping guide  &  they'll have a lot more info. I also totally recommend looking up Stygiomedusa gigantea and fried egg jellyfish if you've never seen them before!
Filibustering is a tactic that evolved in the Senate. It's often called a "parliamentary procedure," as it results not from constitutional law but the internal rules of the legislature. In order to allow time for a bill to be discussed and debated, a 60 vote majority is required to proceed from discussion to a vote. Senators realized they could exploit this rule to keep the majority from passing a bill, unless they had a 60-vote majority (a "Fillibuster-proof majority." Filibusters used to require a significant investment of time. Senators grew weary of the pain of a filibuster, and today, the mere threat of a filibuster is enough to get a bill withdrawn due to the time involved ([Senators in the past were known to read recipes, Shakespeare, anything in sight]( URL_0 )) Now, to your questions: Why is it valid? Because it works for the minority party. Why is it not simply dismissed? No majority will eliminate it because they know it will be useful to them in the future. You'll hear of the "Nuclear Option" from time to time, a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules (by simple majority). So far, it has not happened. I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of use of filibuster is unprecedented (the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old) and scorched-earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway. Does it have any practical uses? Yes: It's a tool for the minority party to block particularly controversial legislation.
I have high functioning autism and while I don't do the hand flapping thing, I will on rare occasions drum my fingers. I don't do it often enough or in rigid enough contexts to consider it a full blown stim, but I do find myself doing the motion in mid-air when I'm trying to remember something during conversations. I usually drum my fingers against something when I'm extremely stressed or trying to find a solution to a problem or scenario. Like a majority of people with autism I have Sensory Processing Disorder, sometimes referred to as hypersensitivity. It dials my senses up to eleven and my brain does not have the ability to tune out portions of my environment or any surrounding stimulus, everything is processed at roughly the same level and understandably can be very overwhelming. It takes a lot of focus to be able to 'tune in' to certain things; in my case spoken words if there are multiple sources of background noise, but it can be almost anything you would try to process/learn. Visuals, smells, questions on a test, etc. Stims are self stimulating behaviors that sort of comfort and calm the person doing them. In the cases in which I'm drumming my fingers I can very clearly feel the interior movements of my fingers joints and how that interior motion is unbelievably smooth within the joint itself. Combine that with hearing the clicking of my nails and the vibrations feeding into my fingers as they connect with whatever surface I'm tapping on, and the tiny twinges of the ligaments and muscles after I've done it for an extended period of time... It's incredibly pleasant to process. Also if you can't glean from my description it's a distracting and strong sensation, enough to distract me from all of the extra outside stimulus the average person is able to automatically filter out. You could almost consider it a form of mediation, at least in my case (remember, this disorder is a spectrum, so experiences can vary wildly) since it can calm me down when I'm under a lot of pressure but it also allows me to focus significantly better when needed. I hope that helps, I'm happy to try and answer more questions or elaborate further if needed.
there is a practice of changing the size/volume of items without changing the price. this practice is colloquially called 'grocery shrink ray' it appears arizona beverages have switched from 12/24 oz. to 11.5/23 oz in in the past 5 years -  URL_0  (went looking and can only find 11.5/23 oz cans at this time)
Oxygen! When the beans are roasted, amino acids and sugars start combining and reacting, creating hundreds of new compounds that make up the smell and flavor of your coffee. There's a name for the process that I can't think of off the top of my head, something like the mallard reaction. These new compounds are tasty, but delicate. Once they've been sitting in your cup getting touched all over by oxygen, they begin to oxidize. Oxidation is the process where oxygen molecules steal electrons from other molecules and they become unstable and start to decay. It's sort of like when you leave a cut apple out and it begins to brown because it's no longer protected by the outside skin.
Because people will pay. Plain and simple. Capitalism at its best.
They are measuring the land (the actual dimension of plot, etc.) and the topography, or changes in elevation. They need to do this so they know exactly what work needs to be done, make sure they comply with set-back and other zoning considerations, know how much dirt needs to be cleared to level the site, and so on.
This would actually be a brilliant idea. The thing is that mental health is often overlooked or underestimated. Even in welfare-societies such as Denmark where the good schools, universities (they actually pay you to study), healthcare and similar things are free (paid for by the government) you still have to pay to get psychiatric therapy unless you have a really big problem. It is a shame that it is that way.
A battery costs money. The circuit to integrate the battery costs money. Designing the circuit to integrate the battery costs money. Assembling the circuit to integrate the battery costs money. No customer at the store chooses which model of microwave to buy based on if it has a battery or not. It is not a selling point. So, adding a battery would cost extra money while not adding to the price the unit could be sold for. Appliances are about the bottom line.
Tl;dr, eli5: Our brains reward us for avoiding threats by releasing feel good chemicals which makes everything else seem rewarding. It's because avoiding things that seem scary, threatening, or overwhelming feels good and is really reinforcing. For example, think about a time where the professor forgot to show up for an exam that you were nervous about or something similar. The world takes on a brighter hue right? Our brains are programmed to release feel good chemicals when we dodge threats. Same thing happens when we get through it and persevere but sometimes people can get stuck in an avoidance behavior pattern.
When you're involved in serious crime that's sure to go to trial they go through the law books and charge you with everything that's even remotely likely to stick. Then during the trial, each charge is answered separately and the jury decides which ones you actually did. This saves the trouble of setting up repeated trials if you happen to get off the first charge they try on.
They are the exact same wheel. All of them. Now you don't have to carry 3 spares based on whether an inner dual or outer dual or front wheel blew out. Cheaper to make one type too. Take off an outer wheel on the back and you'll see the inner looks exactly like the front now. Flip the outer rear around and you'll see it looks exactly like the others now. Edit: You can now see why they are so deeply dished compared to passenger vehicles. The mounting surface has to extend beyond the face of the tire in order for this to work. You'll also see the mounting surface is the same on the concave or convex side of the wheel.
I was under the impression that "gay" could mean either, but suggests male, while "lesbian" always means female. If you want to be more specific, you could specify sex; ie, a gay male, or gay man.
If you are not being formally charged you will get released where you can retain your own lawyer or go to the public defender's office (or equivalent). If you *are* being charged, you will get booked into jail. The phones are free to use until you get assigned a cell. You can try to find a free lawyer at this time but good luck, most require a judge's approval to become your court-appointed attorney, this phone call is usually to call family and bond companies to try and get bailed out of jail. Once you go to a cell it's usually a temporary dorm until you go before a judge. If it's a misdemeanor charge you will see a judge pretty soon, if it's a felony, it can take up to 72 hours to see one. This is the point where you can request a court-appointed attorney, signing paperwork that basically says you can't afford an attorney. After this, if you haven't been bailed out of jail yet, you will probably get moved to permanent classification; another dorm. 1 week - 1 month later (or longer) you will get mail delivered to your cell that has your court-appointed attorney's name, info, etc. If you have a felony charge and cannot bail out of jail, you will have to wait to be indicted (typically by a grand jury) to know when your pre-trial court date is. This can take anywhere from months to almost 2 years. I was in with a guy waiting to be indicted for 22 months.
I would have thought it was the opposite of bearing your teeth to show aggression. Sticking your tongue out of your mouth is very dangerous in an aggressive setting, as you might get hit in the face and bite it off, so it shows that you're not looking for a fight in any way. [(Disregard Maori war dance)]( URL_0 ) Edit: Shit, I got pinged by a grammar bot.
H.P. Lovecraft wrote a whole bunch of really creepy books. Many of them deal with ideas about ancient monsters and aliens which are too complex, strange, otherworldly, or terrible for human minds to comprehend. He explores themes of sanity and fear in his works, and often describes his creatures in purely metaphorical terms. I'm not sure whether all of Lovecraft's stories are considered to take part in the same setting or universe or not. I know they don't all include the same characters, as many of his protagonists end up dead or insane. Also, other authors have since expanded on and added to Lovecraft's work.
hey. i'm a dude who's on steroids, and i've been studying them for about 5 years. i know a lot about them. anabolic steroids are either testosterone or derivatives of it. they are all classed under the "androgen" umbrella rather than the "estrogen" umbrella that corticosteroids are classed under. the body has a lot of receptors for different hormones all over the body. anabolic steroids activate the androgen receptors in the body, many of which are located in muscle cells (although there are also some in bone tissue, kidney tissue, skin, etc). you can think of androgen receptors as locks and anabolic steroids as the keys- when the key opens the lock, it triggers a genetic response in the muscle cells that basically tells the cell to synthesize more protein. this lets muscles recover more quickly and more efficiently. many steroids also exhibit an effect called "nutrient partitioning" which... simply put, changes what your body uses nutrients for. if you've ever seen a [government spending pie chart]( URL_0 ), you can see how there are a lot of different things that the government is spending money on. your body does the same thing with nutrients. lots of different processes to spend calories on. steroids basically make the piece of the pie that would say "building muscle" bigger. as for the health aspect... well, we don't really know for sure. steroids definitely have adverse effects. but of the ones listed, most of them are cosmetic and reversible. the ones that are not cosmetic usually are not reversible, and those are the ones to worry about. the side effects most commonly talked about by the media would be: * roid rage * mental instability * shrunken penis * shrunken testicles * liver problems * kidney problems * heart problems * cancer * baldness * gynecomastia (man boobs) * acne * infertility of those things, a couple aren't even real side effects. shrunken penises do not happen on steroids, i promise. cancer has never been linked to steroids. and there hasn't been any scientific evidence to substantiate the idea of "roid rage." in addition, kidney problems and mental instability as a direct result of steroids have never (as far as i can tell) been directly proven, but i've read about weak correlations. never heard of kidney problems, personally, but mental instability has happened. problem is, the people who use steroids are often not the most mentally stable people in the first place. many of us already suffered from some form of mental illness before we started, and sometimes drugs like antidepressants or antipsychotics can cause symptoms that people will blame on the steroids. of those not mentioned above, many are reversible or preventable entirely. shrunken testicles can be prevented with hCG use, and even if you don't use hCG, they go back to normal when you get off. i've never actually read about a single case of incurable infertility as a result of steroid use either. baldness can be prevented by avoiding certain steroids and using things like finasteride or dutasteride (basically rogaine like stuff). acne can be prevented with a good diet, by controlling your estrogen levels by using certain drugs called aromatase inhibitors, and you know, basic human hygiene. gynecomastia is also preventable with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). and again, both of those things are reversible. the real problems are heart and liver damage. that shit is real. almost all steroids will cause the heart to grow, which is not good. steroid use has been correlated to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues. it's never been explicitly proven but we all know the link is there. injectable steroids actually don't do any harm to the liver, but oral steroids can. their molecular structure is modified in a way allows them to survive the digestive system and become active in the bloodstream. this is called 17-alpha-alkylization and basically means that they cause buildup of toxic materials when they pass through the liver. if abused, they can cause liver damage. but, most responsible steroid users take supplements that help promote healthy liver function, many of which are very effective. if used in moderation, can they be used pretty safely? yeah. you're definitely gonna take some time off your life by using, but that's a risk/reward thing that the individual must consider on their own. personally, it's worth the risk for me. to have a chance to be the best at what i do, i would need to juice no matter what. and i'm following my dreams even if it takes time off of my life. edit: if anyone wants me to go into more detail about anything in particular that i said, i'd be glad to do so, just ask. these explanations are pretty simplified believe it or not. if you're confused about something, i'd love to explain the process behind what i'm talking about and show you what i mean.
Ely5 as much as possible: Your body stops making some chemicals in response to constantly having alcohol in your system. When you suddenly stop drinking, it takes your body a while to realize it needs to make those chemicals again. The lag time between stopping alcohol and chemical production can be a decent amount of time. That's "withdrawal", basically. With alcohol and benzos, that chemical imbalance can be serious enough to kill you. Edit; as others have corrected me, I figured I'd add this for clarity. My post is mostly right, but backwards. The brain doesn't stop making chemicals. It makes way too much, and the alcohol stops the chemicals from working as much. So when you stop drinking, the brain is still making a ton of stuff, but it's all working now instead of being blocked by the alcohol. Sorry for the mix up. My source is a class I took in college a few years ago, and I remembered the gist of it without the details. Thanks again for the corrections! Also, as a word of warning, this shit is serious. When you read that you can die from alcohol or benzo withdrawal, that means YOU CAN DIE. If you or someone you know is trying to get clean off these, they really should check into a clinic or hospital to be safe. Or at least have someone with some knowledge really closely monitor symptoms, and be willing to call for an ambulance if need be. Edit2. Benzos, not barbs. Fixed that in my original post. I'm screwing up all over the details. Damnit.
I'm a certified Paramedic in Ontario and I've responded to epi-pen use when both needed and not needed. Seizures are not a common occurrence with anaphylactic shock, as mentioned below. An Epi-Pen is the brand name for Epinephrine, which is adrenaline. It dilates the blood vessels in and around the respiratory tract, allowing someone with constricting blood vessels around the throat to breathe. If you used the Epi-Pen when you didn't need it, you'd experience something similar to an extreme panic attack. Very high heart rate, jitteriness, nervousness, anxious, increased respiratory rate.
It wasn't so much the form it took (communism), as it was the fact that it was a totalitarian dictatorship run by an insane megalomaniac who couldn't have killed more of his own people if he had done a drive-by from Leningrad to Kamchatka... Totalitarian dictatorships are evil whether they're communist or not...
The smell of metal on your hands after handling keys, coins, etc is actually the smell of your body's natural oils on the surface of your skin reacting in a small way with the metal. Chemical by-products are released, some as vapours that you can smell. Once you remove the metal, the smell lingers until the chemical reaction has 'used up' the available metal atoms and the smell disappears.
Gutters are basically useless in torrential rains, and add wind loading to the house, which you want to avoid in hurricane-prone regions.
There are a few things. (!!!NOT MY OPINION!!!) Mainly, many Americans are politically conservative and therefore do not support state-organised healthcare intervention, paid for through taxation. There are a number of reasons for this: * A fundamental belief that taxation is morally wrong * A desire to pay lower taxes - under nationalised healthcare systems, the health costs of the poorest are paid for by those who are comparatively well off, which some people find objectionable * A big problem is that many Americans have little trust for or faith in the competence of their government, and will oppose it's expansion into any industry * Companies who provide private medicine are obviously against a nationalised health system which cuts them out - they have lobbied fiercely against it * Some people think a better solution can be provided by the private market
Much of India is still very, very poor, combined with a massively dense population of essentially homeless people. Combine it with developing infrastructure, and you get way more people than restrooms. People gotta poop, though.
The first commentor has it spot on but I would definitely like to double down on the notion that the science is young. It definitely is, we learn new things every day. When it comes to our bodies there is still a lot we don't know and sometimes we find out that certain cells interact with certain things in ways we didn't realize before. For example my first year of college I took anatomy and phyisology, after the first semester had ended we had to buy a new version of the textbook because some cutting edge genetic information had just been solidified and it was important to our understanding of the body. This filters out into the other sciences as well. Also, sometimes we perform long-term studies that take many years to realize that what we are using/doing is harmful. Take asbestos as an example. We used to use it in *everything* because it was cheap, flame resistant, and had many many other properties that were desirable. It was until much later that we realized that asbestos caused a good deal many health defects in humans and so had to complete revise construction techniques and methods. This also applies to things like nutrition, we find things out after studying long-term effects that don't match with what we already know and have to change it.
Originally almost all animals that could be domesticated lived in Eurasia, like the cow and pig. The Americas only had the llama, which was still hard to domesticate. Because of the possibility of domesticating animals, communities grew larger, because more food was available. This caused more people to be set free from hunting and agriculture. These people could then devote their time to inventions, which lead to this huge development advantage.
Changing a business computer system is like rebuilding your house while you're still living in it. It seems like a good idea at the time, so you start building new walls around the outside of your house. Then when you get about halfway finished your wife gets pregnant and now you have to work an extra bedroom into the new house. So you move something here and alter something there and you can just about get a new bedroom in. But now the house will cost more and it'll take a few more months to get done. So your wife now decides that since the new house won't be ready in time she needs to have a new kitchen in the old house, so you stop building the new house and put in a new kitchen. But now you see some benefits to the new kitchen, so you change your plans and tweak some things so maybe you can use bits of your new kitchen in the new house. And then solar panels become a thing, so you decide you want them, which means redoing the roof. And then you get a promotion at work and a company car (this is akin to a business getting a new client who works a bit differently from the old clients) so you need to build a garage. And then you stand back having lost some weight and lost some hair, and realise that there wasn't anything really wrong with the old house in the first place, it just needed a bit of attention here and there. But now you have a mish-mash of old house and new house, and the garage is in the pool, and the nursery is nowhere near the main bedroom, and the kitchen is half upstairs and half downstairs, but at least the roof doesn't leak and you still have cable. Just. And that's why businesses don't like to change their computer systems.
It is basically in case the car is in an accident. The sign is for emergency workers so that if there is an accident and they can see the parents, they will look for the baby too and try to save the baby first.
This can happen when there are multiple counts of a serious crime involved. If some of the counts happen to be overturned on an appeal, the sentence will still be life imprisonment due to the other counts.
We don't know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread. Changes in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer. On the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know. Tldr: shits complicated literally edit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which *even scientists* do sometimes. People seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That's really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I'm looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). Until relatively recently we didn't even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I'm sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don't know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don't know much about that. But we're learning. There is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don't think that it will be the same in everyone. example: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don't, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I'm going? We do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a "fix" but as a supplement. it's just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). tldr2: no really, shit's complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don't know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal "live a healthy lifestyle" advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don't ask for a quick fix and don't trust anyone who offers one. Here are some links about the microbiome and a couple on the microbiome and gluten.  URL_3   URL_4   URL_5   URL_1   URL_6   URL_2   URL_0  edit2: yes, non celiac wheat/gluten intolerance exists. some studies have shown that people who claim to have it do not, but that does not encompass all the literature. the key to those studies is that they were looking at SELF REPORTED gluten intolerance, so basically your average "but gluten" person, not people who were medically evaluated and thought to have it. turns out you just have to find the right people to study (who actually have it). just skim this google scholar search and you will see significant evidence of its existence:  URL_7 
The United States Constitution represents are very difficult compromise that tied together many states into one country. If you look at some of the heated political debates during the formation of our country, you'll be amazed that we ever got along, let alone were so successful. Even though it is a very short document compared to other constitutions, it has never needed to be rewritten, and has needed to be amended much less frequently. Our constitutional system has never collapsed or been suspended. Even during the Civil War, when the constitutional system was most at risk, the ordinary functions of state (elections, judicial oversight, etc.) continued in the North. The Constitution is remarkable in great part because it does not need to spell everything out in the excessive detail of, say, the Indian constitution. Its provisions are readily understandable by common people, and the fine application of those principles to specific cases is left to the judicial branch. The Constitution is not perfect, certainly not. But it has served us very well, and if you look at the political crises other countries have faced that we have avoided, it is certainly among the great political documents of Western civilization. You're bothered that the Constitution isn't exactly what you want it to be. That some of it is open to debate. That's a good thing--because otherwise, the country would have fallen apart long ago.
Well Billy, it's like this... When you're young, being an adult seems like a really great thing. You get to have car, live in your own place, stay up as long as you want, eat whatever you like, and there's all that naughty stuff you're not allowed to do as a kid. But the thing is... all of those things cost money. And to have money, you usually have to work for it. Not everyone gets be what "they want to be when they grow up". Lots of jobs require schooling or knowing certain people, and those things can cost a lot of money too. You don't really have to worry about money at your age, but the lives of adults revolve around money, for the most part. Cars are expensive, not just to buy, but to keep. You've got to keep gas in them, have them registered and insured, do regular maintenance so they keep working... Even if your car is just sitting in your driveway doing nothing, it still technically costs you money. Having a place of your own is like that too. Sure, you can leave your clothes and toys wherever you like, but you've got to pay rent, or a mortgage, or property taxes. You've also got to pay for utilities so you have water and electricity. If you want nicer things like cable TV, the internet or a cell phone, you've got to pay for all of those as well, every month. You may have lots of toys and clothes and furniture, but if you don't pay the monthly costs of having a place to keep them in.. you're not going to have them for very long. But you can eat whatever you like, whenever you like. This is also sort of a problem. If you have poor metabolism, poor impulse control or other biological issues, you may give yourself health problems by being careless about what you eat. You could get fat, or get diabetes. You might have problems with dairy products or gluten, but if you've never been properly diagnosed, you may just be suffering with being gassy or congested after eating your favorite foods. So, if you eat too much of whatever you like, you may soon find yourself not able to eat what you like, and that can be distressing. But you can stay up as long as you want! However, if you have a job to pay the many bills associated with being an adult, you most likely have to get up at a certain time to go to work. That means.. you're going to lose out on sleep, and feel awful the next day, if you stay up too late. And if you keep doing that, it's going to affect your job performance. And then your job might fire you. Which means you can't afford to keep your nice things. So you really should go to bed at a regular time. But hey, there's all that good naughty stuff. Drinking, recreational drugs, sex, porn... Except, too much of any of these things can outright kill you. Drinking can destroy your body over time if you have too much, and so can drugs. Sex generally won't, but... there's a lot of sickness that can be passed around by sex if you're not careful. And they can be far worse than any cold or flu you've ever had. Those sicknesses can kill you too, so you should be careful who you have sex with. Porn won't ruin your life, persay, but it can give you the wrong idea and expectations about sex with a real person.. and that can kind of ruin your fun. Kids have a lot of time to do fun things. Lots of times, nice family members will help buy you things to keep you entertained or fuel your hobbies. Adults don't have as much time, and rarely do people buy things for us if it's not a special occasion. That means we often have less hobbies, particularly if we work a lot. And we get even less time to have personal hobbies when we start having relationships and families. Those things often take lots of time and effort to get right. Adults know all these things. It doesn't make us sad, so much as it gives us a sense of stress. This stress makes some people irritable and angry, it leaves others feeling tired and run down. Lots of people distract from this stress of adulthood by watching a lot of TV, playing a lot of video games, reading a lot of books or drinking. Some adults try to change all this by appealing to management and government. Not *every* country has it quite like we do. Some are better, some are worse. Some have more vacation days, some have none. Some are paid more on average, some are not. Some places don't have paid schooling, which makes learning what you want to do much easier, but those places may also have more difficult job markets to get into. But just like every person, businesses and governments have their own idea of what would be best. It's a long, drawn out series of arguments for how to improve this system so things aren't so expensive and people have more time to enjoy themselves, rather spending most of their time working to merely support themselves. But because our management systems are complicated and our government seems to fight amongst themselves rather than listening to the majority of the people they represent, it often seems like the situation is never going to improve. That's part of why people are depressed, Billy. And that's all without mentioning the wars and the suffering and the poverty in countries other than our own, places we would like to help because they're people just like us... but we're too busy struggling to get by ourselves, to really help them as much as we'd like. Grown up life is hard, Billy. I'm sorry.
Kubrick had a highly unusual eye for detail and was a complete perfectionist. There's practically nothing in a single Kubrick frame that is accidental, and he would strive *endlessly* to get the exact, perfect result that he wanted - look up some of the horror stories from the cast of The Shining, like making Shelly Duvalle re-shoot scenes hundreds of times in one day with the deliberate intention of getting her exhausted and stressed out to get the right look. His films, for better or for worse, are intricate puzzle boxes full to the brim with hidden meanings and subtleties.
Stress mostly. The anticipation of arriving, dealing with airlines, traffic, countless unknown people and disturbances, and the mental effort required to deal with all of that. In my experience mental and emotional stress make me a lot more tired than physical exertion.
The origin of the name for Germany in a certain language depends on that country's one time relationship with Germany. Allemagne, Alemania (Romance languages) -- comes from the Alemani tribe of Germany. Germaniya, Germany, Germania -- that is the name which the Romans used for the territory north and East of the Rhine. Saksa -- Finnish, named after the Saxons, yet another German tribe. Deutschland, Duitsland -- this was yet another German tribe which became the word for the whole country.
I’ve read before that chewing gum helps with anxiety because it tricks the brain into thinking you’re eating which makes your brain think you are not in any danger, there for keeping you out of fight or flight mode.
Wow, okay, everyone is coming in here with charged answers and edgy statements, or answering what falls under a war crime rather than why the list is what it is. War crimes are basically what we decided is in the best interest of everybody to avoid, regardless of what the war is. We, as a world, understand that war itself will pretty much never go away. Countries will have conflicts over trade and land and such, and one of the ways in which they will decide the conflict is through war. What we've decided is that war is first and foremost a **conflict between states**. Governments and their actors i.e military. When Russia invaded Georgia or Crimea, it wasn't some Russian woman at the grocery store, it was Putin, his government, and his military. We want war to follow a simple formula. War is declared, the military carries out a series of strikes and offenses against each other, one side concedes and an agreement is made as to the conditions of victory. There is no need to go overboard on certain things. We've decided that doing so would cause unnecessary further damage to innocent people, or cause lasting effects beyond typical combat. We don't want those things to happen to us, so we won't do it to them. This is where we get the list of war crimes such as chemical warfare, torture, killing innocent civilians etc. We sure as shit do not want chemical warfare to be used against us, and it's pretty easy to not do chemical warfare when you have several other methods of killing enemy combatants. It's basically a way to still allow war to occur in the least damaging way possible. It sounds ludicrous, because war is in and of itself horrible, but it's a morbid practicality.
It is a very specific and expensive technology that isn't well suited for home use. If we absolutely needed to conserve water like that, we would, but tap water is _really_ cheap (in the USA at least).
Two really key points that need to be straightened out first before answering you. * Very few influential people are claiming that climate change isn't happening, there's just too much evidence for it. What a number of people are doing is claiming that climate change (in the form of regional effects of global warming) is not being caused by HUMAN activity. If it's a natural process, we can't be to blame for it. * Different people have different motivations. Some people honestly do believe that the "truth" is humans aren't causing it, either because their own research leads them to this conclusion or because they believe other people's messages and they're just conveying those opinions onward. So let's talk about the people who originally create those messages that others might follow, and answer your question. Many of those people sometimes have very strong interests in disconnecting human activity sources from climate change results. They work for or represent companies that do things like produce lots of greenhouse gas, or produce and sell non-renewal energy sources like coal and gasoline. So their livelihood depends on people not believing that they're causing a potential problem, and they do their best to try and suppress that belief. Or they're argumentative as a job or as a hobby. A lot of the conspiracy theorists out there don't believe any messages that come from government, and apply less-than-scientific processes to their cherry-picked analysis of what the causes are. They either get their kicks doing it, or get a paycheck from doing it.
The line ups are staged. They don't put a bunch of possible suspects in the line up, the line up has the one suspect and 4-5 other people that may look similar but are not at all under investigation. If the witness points to anyone but the actual suspect then it casts doubt on the witness.
I think the argument here is that even though the drug is arguably much more potent than it used to be, people are still consuming roughly the same quantity of the drug per sitting so the effects are stronger than they used to be. I do not know whether or not that is actually true though.
Because "innocent until proven guilty" is a legal concept about legal punishment, not some rule about talking on the internet or whatever stupid thing you are trying to make it.
Nobody believes that DRM is going to prevent piracy, it's there to slow it down and make pirating the game inconvenient. It's the difference between having the game available on torrents an hour after launch that can be installed and run just by double clicking the icon and having it on torrents a couple of days after launch that requires a bit of reading to get it working. People are willing to pay to get things quicker and with less effort.
I politely disagree with many of those posting here. Let me try to ELI5. Pressure isn't as large of a factor as you might think. It is to us, because we're not adapted to it and our bodies really can't take it. But, we and most other things are actually made out of liquids. Liquid doesn't squish very much. Food is what decides how big things get. If you are thinking about size and think about fish, well, they only get so big. Whale sharks are pretty huge for a fish, but compared to warm blooded mammals, the great whales, they're actually pretty average. Ironically, the largest boney fish - the Sun Fish - spends most of its time quite deep, hunting jellyfish. But it has to come up to the warmer waters near the surface to warm up from time to time. It's hard being cold-blooded. It takes energy to do things and that's why food is such an important factor. Many deeper ocean creatures that are active predators - that hunt for food, instead of just kind of gather it - don't stay in the deep parts all the time. They "go out for dinner" coming to the shallows to hunt and then go back down later. Some of these are quite large, especially among jellyfish  & amp; their relatives and squids. It is believed the largest squids in the world live this way. And some of them wouldn't fit in your living room, OP. Even at the bottom there are some big sharks that move about - six gill, seven gill and sleeper sharks can get big - longer and larger than a car. Then there's the mammals that spend a bit of time in the deeper ocean, like sperm whales. They're big. Then there's the things that live down there all the time. The majority of these are small, limited in size mostly due the availability of food. However, on the abyssal plain - the sandy flat part of the ocean between the mountains that form islands and sea mounts and the crevices that form trenches - there are fields and fields of spiny skinned sea stars and sea urchins, walking along in their tube feet, hoovering up food that's slowly sunk down to the bottom. They move in giant herds. There's so many, and the area is so big - it's the single largest habitat on Earth - that they might actually be the largest amount of animals on the planet, by weight. That's despite what everyone says about bugs. Beetles. Everyone thinks they're so cool. But then there's the bottoms of the trenches. So far there's no Pacific Rim sized Kayju down there that we've found, but when you stop thinking fish and start thinking other things there's some real possibility. Hydrothermic vents are these cracks in the sea floor where really hot (like hotter than boiling) water comes shooting out, full of chemicals. There are creatures that can live next to these vents and live in the water who use the chemicals in the water for food. There's a type of tube worm that lives there that can stand hotter than boiling water, that has no digestive tract - no tummy, no intestines and never goes poop - that is over 1 metre long. That may not sound all that big, but that's pretty huge for a tube worm. They appear to be limited in size by the size of the vents they live on. Vents are little underwater volcanos. Get a big one and you get big tube worms. There are some rather large colonial jellyfish types down there that grow to be the size of a football field in length. That's pretty big. Then there's the less impressive - mostly because they don't move around - but really huge bottom dwellers. Deep sea corals can be hundreds of meters long, just like their shallow water counterparts. As corals grow they leave their skeletons behind, which is what makes up reefs. There are massive deep-sea sponges that are thousands of years old. Then there are things like the methane-seep living cyanobacteria colonies. Those things are miles and miles across - bigger than anything on land. I don't expect them to wade ashore to crush Tokyo anytime soon tho. They get massive because they live right next to a food source that's been like an all you can eat buffet for thousands of years, and is still going strong. TLDR: Pressure isn't that big of a deal. It's all about food. EDIT: Removed an elephant to whale shark comparison as it was just plain wrong.
From what I have read in a few places, why we need sleep and feel mentally refreshed afterwards is still not well understood. They know about the rem cycles, and we need stage 4 to feel refreshed, but that's about it. I posit that just like a computer has to defrag, so do our minds. My dreams are always slight reflections of my day and the stresses there in, secret emotions and even lusts I feel throughout the day are all manifest in some form. I feel like when I sleep my waking consciousness that has to "think" all day is shut down and there is an auto pilot running training maneuvers for my minds worries in 4000K ultra while tripping acid.
Basic explanation: You have animals producing offspringThere will be slight variations between offspring and parents. These differences are due to recombinant of genes (you are a combo of genes from your mom and your dad, so you aren't exactly like either one of them) and from mutation. Mutation is when a part of your DNA is accidentally changed (many ways this can happen). Some mutations don't cause any change while others can have a huge effect. These mutations can create new traits that did not exist in your species before. Now, as populations of animals create new offspring and live they must compete with each other and other animals to survive. They must also survive environmental factors such as weather. This struggle for survival causes what is referred to as selective pressure. Basically what it means it is since it is difficult to live only the best animals will be able to survive and reproduce. (This isn't 100%, but the idea is your chances of surviving and reproducing are higher if you are a better individual). if only the best survive and you have random changes between generations then any new mutations that are a benefit to the animal will survive and be passed on to more and more offspring while any traits that are disadvantageous will eventually die of. In this way species slowly change over many generations to become better adapted to their situation
It is efficient to use the heat from a power plant to heat buildings. First the the steam is used to spin the turbines for electricity production. The steam is still hot but to extract more heat from the steam the turbine blades would have to be enormous. The pressure is below atmospheric pressure. To condense the steam cooling towers are used. Or the heat can be routed to warm buildings. The building have to be close. The engineers have figured this all out. They are really smart and use a lot of math.
Technically, when you look in the mirror every morning, you are looking into the past.
this is one of the interesting issues with legalizing marijuana; there is really no way of telling. To be fair, even if it becomes legal, thats no guarantee that companies will be okay with it. Its very likely that heavy machine operators wouldn't be able to smoke for this very reason.
It can happen with newer/poorly trained dogs and handlers. As others have said, experienced dogs and their handlers are able to read/judge each other well. The most commonly utilized 3 breeds in the US at the moment (German Shepherd, Belgian Malinois, Dutch Shepherd) are historically used as perimeter herders for livestock. They will go after/herd something that is fleeing if they have a pretty strong instinct intact. That of course is ideal when picking out candidates for training, but can take a lot of work to focus the instinct. A lot of dogs are also trained to be more in tune with the emotions the suspects are expressing too, so chances of a well trained dog going after an innocent are slim. We used to do a training exercise called "the happy dance" where the handler would stand calmly with the dog at plotz(laying down) and another worker would pass by and think aggressively and make gestures. The dog would get up at the alert between the person and it's handler and go nuts at the guy. Then the guy would turn around, calm down, and be happy sounding and the dog would change it's posture and lay back down almost instantly. Source- worked with a K9 security company, and owned a pretty high drive flunk out Dutchie (flunked because his drive was the wrong kind for the job. Unless the perpetrators were always on bicycles... or were actual sheep.) Edit- for all those saying "so I should just turn around and say WHO'S A GOOD BOY" or "so I should just try to play with him", I know you're trying to be funny but no. You should honestly stop and lay on the ground with your face down. The dog will still come towards you, but they are often trained to guard the suspect on the ground until the handler arrives to arrest. The handler will call the dog off. That game we played was to test the dogs protective instinct for the handler or a threat more than anything but is an exercise for the dogs judgment no less.
For the most part we can eat raw meat too. We are the only species that saves are raw meat for days/weeks/months to eat later and that is what makes us have to cook it. We could eat raw meat assuming we eat the meat directly after the animal was killed. It is not the raw meat that is dangerous, it is what grows on the meat after it is dead.
They are called phosphenes, and if I recall, they are the result of phantom stimuli. The brain isn't used to having no stimuli from a major sensory organ like the eye, so it'll make up 'static' in the absence of sight. Unless you mean the ones you get from rubbing your eye. That's because the light sensing cells in the retina are so sensitive that the increased pressure in the eye will set them off.
I think it depends what sources you're looking at. A lot of people criticise the vastly and ridiculously inflated salaries that athletes get in comparison to, for example, doctors. Anytime there's a story about a footballer demanding a wage rise because they're "only" earning £100k per week is generally met with scorn and derision, especially because 90% of the people paying money to watch them could only dream of earning that sort of cash. CEO stories are more compelling because there's an element whereby they can actually DO something about the disparity in wages, should they choose to, whereas the average sports star doesn't really control the wages of the other people who work for the team, say.
Mandated car insurance covers drivers you hit, it doesn't cover you. Comprehensive insurance, which does, is not normally mandated.
Until 1995, there was a national speed limit law that required speed limits of 55 (later 65)mph or less on interstates and tied federal highway aid to states imposing these limits on state roads too. As a result, a lot of states (especially out west) implemented artificially low speed limits and enforced them with "wasting a natural resource" tickets that charged as little as possible and allowed the state to say they were doing something. As a result, you got a culture of taking speed limits as more suggestion than law. In 1989 Montana, for example, anyone caught going under 90 but above 65 could expect a $5 fine, payable on the spot. Additionally, people tend to drive at a speed they feel comfortable at based on traffic, road quality, and surrounding obstacles. Things like trees, street parking, and pedestrians/bicycles tend to make people drive slower and open roads have the opposite effect. States, cities, and counties realize this and will do things like lower a speed limit right before a town and have a cop there to write tickets (the government keeps the fines).
It's hard to pin down a single reason, and it's also very difficult to be objective. It's easy to say that America has the most liberal gun laws of western industrialised nations and also the highest intentional homicide rate of western industrialised nations not currently in a state of war, but it might be slightly more complicated than that. For example, Germany has some of the world's strictest gun laws and does have a very low murder rate compared with the US, but the worst school shootings in recent decades have taken place in Germany. It is very hard to escape the fact that liberal gun laws coupled with a general culture of violence plus inadequate treatment of psychiatric disorders are to blame, but to what extent each of these factors is to blame is not easy to determine. If we pick on just the gun ownership aspect, the cases normally raised in these discussions are Switzerland and Australia. Switzerland has a very high incidence of legal gun ownership, but the usual explanation that "all Swiss citizens are legally required to have guns" isn't quite accurate. In fact, most Swiss males in their twenties and thirties are conscripted into the militia, and are required to take their service weapons home with them -- but are not allowed to take any ammunition. (In the past, ammunition was issued in sealed boxes, and the seals were constantly checked and the bullets counted.) Still, most Swiss households have guns, and it is possible to get hold of ammunition. And it is true that despite that, Switzerland has a very low murder rate. Interestingly, though, while planned crimes -- armed robbery, for example -- are typically carried out using illegally held weapons, there is a higher-than-expected rate of domestic homicides -- crimes of passion -- and these are carried out using legally-held service weapons. So if you want to hold up a bank, you get a gun on the black market that can't be traced to you; if you catch your wife in bed with the insurance salesman, you grab the nearest weapon to hand which happens to be a gun. Similarly, there is this thing going round that guns are now banned in Australia and that as a result the murder rate has shot up. Neither of those things are true: guns were restricted in 1996, but not banned, in Australia, and the murder rate appears to have gone down but was always very low anyway. Different researchers have come up with very different interpretations of the same figures, but it seems that gun crime was on the way down anyhow, and the 1996 legislation didn't make much difference. The only thing anyone can say for sure is that fewer suicides are committed using guns, which just means that people determined to kill themselves are turning to different methods. TL;DR: It's much more complex than lots of people will have you believe, but it is almost certainly a mixture of many different factors.
So, this supposed "rule" of grammar is known as a [prescriptive rule]( URL_0 ): there is no inherent reason why you can't end a sentence with a preposition, other than because people consider it "bad form." Like wearing a t-shirt to fancy dinner party; there's nothing inherently *wrong* about it, it's just considered bad taste. If you're asking where the actual rule comes from; it was invented by 19th century grammarians, who thought that the idea of a *pre*position coming at the end of a sentence was inherently illogical.
In the US Chinese, Japanese and Korean people are more numerous than Indians. So because they look kind of similar to each other, and they are the people from Asia who most Americans are likely to encounter, they became known as "Asians". While Indian people are also from Asia, they clearly look very different from Chinese/Japanese/Koreans, so they didn't get lumped in under the same term. This is actually the opposite in the UK. Here Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are called "Asians". Probably for the same reason. There are more people originally from those countries in the UK than there are Chinese, Japanese and Koreans.
 > They can't possibly just have millions of wires that connects everything Yup. That's exactly what they have (obviously it's a far more advanced setup than just connected cables, but when you think about the fact that [this]( URL_0 ) is just one network closet for one wing of one businesses building, it starts to make sense why they have so many. It wasn't built overnight.) ISP's maintain their network via huge data centers and routing centers which manage all the traffic. Multiple ISP's interact by all connecting to large backbone routing centers managed by various groups (ICANN, I believe is one, I don't know if the government runs some or if ICANN has them all). In theory, you could connect yourself directly to an internet backbone server to circumvent your ISP, but you'd have to physically run cable from your house up to the poles (owned by the ISP and regulated by the city/county/etc), across all said ISP-owned poles over to the internet backbone servers. Then they'd have to give you permission to run the line into that buildings server room and hook up to the server, then they'd need to configure the server to give you a connection. The whole getting permission part (from the ISP who owns the poles, the city that regulates the lines, the multiple ISP-owned poles and lines you'd need to connect/use to get to the backbone, and the backbone itself) would never fly. You'd never make it up the pole behind your yard.
A lawyer will be able to make what you write in the will legally enforceable and clear in its meaning. If you are a layperson who is Googling what goes into a will it is likely that you will be using colloquial language that you think is obvious in its meaning, but legal rulings are based very much on precedent. By precedent I mean if a particular phrase was ruled to mean the same thing for the last 150 years then you can be very confident what it means when you use it. The problem is that phrasing is 150 years old and sounds antiquated, but it is better than your modern way of speaking which has no precedent.
4K 4096x2160 is a digital cinema resolution, similar to 2k in aspect ratio which is 2048x1080. The broadcast world uses aspect ratios of 16x9, e.g, 1920x1080, or 3840 x 2160. In cinema, there are two overall aspect ratios depending what the content is, if your film is 1.78 - 2.0, people tend to use a flat container, meaning the image is scaled into a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio, introducing letterbox if the active image aspect ratio is greater than 1.89:1. For titles with aspect ratios larger than 2, e.g 2.4 or 2.35 or 2.39 and more, they'll use the frame called scope, which has a pixel aspect ratio or 1.5:1. Basically so they can squeeze more content into a frame, in this case preserving the vertical information more so than the horizontal. When the image is projected, the image is unsqueezed, preserving more detail or image than would exist in a flat container. Broadcast/ consumer electronics are more restricted, in order to broadcast over the air, the distribution architecture decided on 16x9. Some televisions do support digital cinema initiative frames, many 4K capable televisions will squeeze 4096x2160 content into a 3840x2160 frame. Most people won't notice, however you can usually notice some minor aliasing or thinning of people when this occurs.
They're tall because of their diets. The Nordic countries have been eating well since World War II, and their diets consist of a good mix of vegetables, fish, meat and fruit, plus lots of high-protein staples. School kids in the Nordic countries are served hot, balanced lunches every day. Vitamin D is not the sole contributor to height.
Getting pregnant on purpose is super easy, unless it's not. Almost 90% of women have no problem getting pregnant, but for the other 10%, it's a very stressful thing, so that 10% gets a lot more sympathy and coverage.
a) When it's dark you have reduced vision of your surrounding b) When you are alone you don't have a group around you to connect with or to feel secured with Those two things make you feel more vulnerable. We tend to want to connect with people because we have greater chance of survival in a group than alone and we want to connect with others and be accepted and liked etc. The reason why we can feel anxiety giving a speech is because we might embarrass ourselves and therefore not liked by the group etc. We feel anxiety and fear because it protects us. If there's a danger your body tells you to flight or fight. So those feelings make us realize that we need to do something. So when you feel alone and it's dark, you feel more vulnerable. The fear you then feel triggers the anxiety/ fear/ paranoid phenomena, either memories, or stronger feelings or potential perceived threats (future threats) etc. Have a look at "sleep paralysis" and the theory behind it, it also works on the vulnerability and the perceived threat of something supernatural.
Here's the thing about a housefly: It's really fucking dumb. It's got a tiny brain and limited reasoning. So applying any sort of logic to it's action is probably a fool's errand. It's better to look at a fly like a robot with a very specific task. For a housefly? That task is **Find rotting meat and/or feces. EAT.** Somehow they've also shoehorned in **BREED** as an alternate task. So the fly going around like crazy in your room? It's probably following some very simple search algorithm to find rotting meat and/or shit in your room. It doesn't think "No shit around here, time to move on", it thinks "no shit directly below me, turn left" or something like that. Animal behavior is written by millions of years of evolution, and especially for the dumb animals like a housefly, it's probably not all that effective at adapting to humanity's dominance over the Earth, which is only a few thousand years old.
If it's a legal excuse for a mild crime, it's a valid legal excuse for a serious one. "I didn't realize massive theft/murder was illegal in this country."
Just so you know, it's "reservation", not "preservation". And casinos are good money makers that can be operated by native peoples on their own land even if gambling is illegal in the surrounding US state.
So the problem here is that you're dancing around the semantic problem of defining "nothingness". In physics, nothing is *nothing*: even empty space is a frothing sea of quantum foam with particles spontaneously popping in and out of existence constantly. Inside the universe, there is no such thing as "nothing". In that context, from what we think we might possibly know about "before" the universe, it's possible that our universe spontaneously sprang from "nothing" in the same way that particles out in empty space spring up from "nothing". There might be a potential for universes to exist, and our universe is the result of that potential. But that brings up another semantic point: what was "before" the universe? Well, there is no "before", because time is a function of the universe. You can't say "before" the universe because that requires a dimension of time that's moving in one direction. Imagine a line starting at one point and going infinitely off in one direction. What's on the line before it starts? There *is no line* before the line starts. We're using words and concepts that necessarily must exist within our universe and according to its rules to try to describe something that exists outside of those boundaries. So there's going to be some places where the semantics just don't fit how we normally think of them.
Because they're the six repeating digits of 1/7. If you times it by 2 (2/7) they're still going to repeat, just starting at a different place.
It's because the "standard" household voltage is not "standard" at all. In Brazil we even say 110V when it is actually 127V. We have most places using 127V and some with 220V. It is not 110- > 220 because we use 3-phase distribution. For example in my house I receive 3 phase 220V and a Neutral (4 conductors), so I have 127V (phase-Neutral) outlets and 220V (phase-phase) outlets, and it is easy to convert one to the other just by rewiring. The relation in a 3-phase system is 127 * 3/√3 = 220 There is also an allowed deviation of 10%. Another thing which is not standard is the frequency. We (Brazil), as in the US use 60Hz, whereas I believe the normal in Europe is 50Hz. That caused weird problems with devices which used the mains frequency as a time reference (like cheap alarm clocks).
The Caucasus mountains are not in central Asia they are in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. Europe and Asia are one land mass (along with Africa) where Europe ends and Asia begins is arbitrary and down to historical reasons. These mountains are one of the arbitrary geographical features that divides Europe from Asia (along with the Urals farther north). In the 19th, or possibly 18th, century a German dude named Blumanbach(?) tried to divide the world up into 3 great races; Negroid were black Africans; Mongoloids were east Asians (what Americans mean when the say "Asian"); Caucasoids were European, North African and Asians from Europe to somewhere in India. **This whole thing was psuedoscience** but it did not try to divide people by skin tone, rather it was by skull features. Anyway, this dude had a skull of a woman from Georgia which he designated to have the definitive features of all Caucasoid people and theorized that this was where the first Caucasoid people originated. The term was used in US legal system for who was allowed to enter the USA. So in 1922 when a Japanese dude who had white coloured skin wanted to become naturalised they wouldn't allow him because he wasn't Caucasion, then one year later when a dude from India who was Caucasion said "hey I want to become a citizen" the supreme court said "Yeaaah, about that, we know you are caucasion but we really only meant white caucasions, so fuck you". Thus to Americans caucasian means people from Europe (although plenty of west Asians and North Africans are white). It is a silly term and shouldn't be used for anyone that's not from the Caucasus region. Also Hispanic and Arabic have nothing to do with skin colour. And when Americans say Asian they don't include about half of Asia. Sometimes Americans will get offended if you point out that Asia includes many more people or that their are white Hispanic and Arabic people, but they are just silly-Billies.
[In his own words]( URL_0 ):  >  A number of detractors have suggested that if Snowden, who disclosed controversial top-secret N.S.A. programs to reporters, truly wanted to commit an act of civil disobedience for reasons of conscience, then he should have faced the legal consequences, making his case to the American public while standing trial at home.  >  When I asked why he didn’t take this route, Snowden said that because of the way national-security laws have been interpreted since September 11, 2001, he believed that the government had deprived him, and other whistle-blowers, of ever having the opportunity to make their cases in this time-honored tradition. Instead of being allowed to make his arguments in an open, public court, he said, his lawyers were told that the government would close the court for national-security reasons. (When asked to comment, a Justice Department spokesman would say only, “It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the charges filed against him. If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.”)  >  Snowden said that he would “love” to return to the United States and stand trial, if he could be assured that it would be open and fair. He said, “I have told the government again and again in negotiations that if they’re prepared to offer an open trial, a fair trial, in the same way that Daniel Ellsberg got, and I’m allowed to make my case to the jury, I would love to do so. But they’ve declined.”  >  Instead, Snowden said, “They want to use special procedures. They want a closed court. They want to use something called the Classified Information [Procedures] Act.” So basically, two reasons. One, he doesn't believe he will be given a fair, impartial trial conducted according to recognized rules of evidence. Two, he fears that the American public will never hear the result of his trial. Critics might accuse him of demanding a "show" trial, open to the public, so that he can use the court to grandstand on issues important to him. But I think a more fair interpretation is that he has sacrificed his freedom and his career in order to expose abuse of surveillance within the US government, and he fears that facing a secret trial here would mean that that abuse would be covered up permanently.
Our body seeks to metabolize drugs because they are putting us into an unnatural state. We want to get back to 'normal' state for our own bodies. So we become more and more efficient at clearing out the drug by making more enzymes that aid in breaking down the drug, as well as we are becoming more use to that drugged up state. Certain drugs that act in place of natural hormones such as insulin, our bodies do not really build up a tolerance to.
EDIT: For the actual 5 year olds, feel free to ignore anything written between the (parenthesis) - this is extra stuff for people to Google-search for if interested. --- I program 3D graphics engines. To calculate a triangle, you just need 3 points and then you fill the space between them. This simple nature allows for some optimisation; we know that only the pixels between these 3 points will be modified when rastered. We can use this knowledge to simplify how the triangle is shaded, so simple texture mapping is just a case of interpolating texture co-ordinates between these points (keeping depth in mind for perspective correctness). There's more optimisations to be had here that will take a lot of explaining (our GPUs have evolved to be very good at dealing with space between 3 points). To calculate a rounded surface, you need an equation for the 3D curve, as well as the limits of the surface. Interpolating texture co-ordinates here would involve re-using that equation over and over again, quite the expensive operation. That equation may also "push" the pixels of the surface out into unexpected directions, so optimisations related to the flatness of a simple triangle are going to be much more difficult (they'd need the 3D curve equation to be used again - clipping would definitely be more complex). As a result, early graphics hardware evolved to be very efficient with triangles and all the research and development has been spent there, resulting in real-time graphics to be as amazing as it is right now in its current state. To go back and make a new way of rendering would involve a new class of graphics acceleration hardware that doesn't have all the years of development of the triangle-based hardware we have, that's not a good trade-off. The graphics hardware we have now is also great at sending additional information along with the XYZ positions of a triangle vertex, so we can send texture UV, XYZ normal, reflectivity, roughness, and more as additional numbers tied to triangle vertices and these get interpolated between the triangle points too, very handy. As GPUs get more and more generalised as compute-oriented machines, rather than triangle-rastering-oriented machines, we may see new types of rendering (real-time ray-tracing is possible now, as is voxel based rendering) but these almost always will be slower than using current hardware to render a triangle, so we see these techniques getting used in parallel to triangle-based rendering to achieve effects that aren't as efficient with a triangle-based world (voxels are fast for real-time global illumination, ray-marching [limited ray-tracing] is faster for limited reflections in scenes limited by the amount of triangles displayed). Perhaps one day we'll gain a "curve" shader where we can use a curve equation to do a perfectly smooth surface between the points of a triangle (I expect the nature of current raster hardware will allow for some cheats here, interpolating between fragments come to mind), but for the time being that's slower than just having lots of triangles to better estimate the curve with current hardware.
Multiple considerations here. For one, the US is largely geographically isolated from the world's geopolitical hot spots. In the 20th century, that was Europe. These past 20 years, the Middle East. In this century, it may well become Asia. As a result of lessons learned from WW2, the US has maintained that it's best defense is to keep forces and the capability to keep forces overseas. That means a Navy that can deliver men and materiel overseas and the ability to defend them from submarines and aircraft. That means an Air Force that has hundreds of aerial refueling tankers and strategic airlift transports (e.g., the US has over 400 tankers and 220 strategic transports - the rest of NATO nations combined have a grand total of around 40 dedicated tankers and 20 strategic transports). But on the other end, you need bases for said troops and materiel to be put at. Hence nations come into agreement with the US to station troops in their nation. Contrary to popular belief, these aren't imposed on the host nations - not now, anyways. Nations must sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for the US to station troops. A SOFA states the legal rights of US troops in host nation - for instance, a SOFA in the UAE woild bar US troops from being subject to local Sharia laws we disagree with. You'll note too that the four nations with the most US troops overseas are Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Italy. Three of those four are the vanquished Axis foes of WW2. As a result of various treaties to end the war, those nations were occupied by US and Allied forces, which is how many of these bases came into US hands. Heck, the UK still has British Forces Germany - a contingent of 5000 that aren't due to depart until 2020, a full 75 years after the war ended! In addition to economic and political benefits of US troops stationed overseas (a lot of developing nations get money poured in from it, and it's a source of employment for locals too), South Korea is a good example of another reason nations may want us. By keeping US troops in the country and along the DMZ, any attack by North Korea will inevitably kill Americans. That guarantees the US would respond. These tripwire forces are a big reason Poland and other Eastern European nations are more than happy to station US troops there, even as Western Europe is less happy about them. I want to add too that the US has **simultaneous** defense treaties with NATO and Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. A war with North Korea does not absolve the US of fulfilling it's defense treaty with Europe if they get in a fight with Russia. As thus, the US prefers to keep forces overseas to stop it from getting to a fight in the first place. Finally, European and Asian militaries benefit from reciprocal agreements. Not only do those nations get to train directly with their American counterparts, but they have agreements to use US bases in the US. That's right, we have foreign troops stationed in the US. Did you know that the German Air Force has squadrons stationed in the US at Holloman AFB in New Mexico and NAS Pensacola in Florida? Hell, did you know that tiny Singapore - yes, Singapore - has FOUR Air Force squadrons stationed in the US. The vast airspace and land we have allows a lot of smaller nations to train. And they get the benefit of a US alliance? It's a no brainer for a lot of nations
Usually the NDA specifies what you are not allowed to disclose. I have one because I may work on/with some technology that isn't public yet. Also, I'm not allowed to give out technical details about what I'm doing. If I breach the NDA my contract may be terminated and I can be forced to pay a certain fee. This does not extend to other stuff that may happen in the office.
There are many pharmaceutical companies that explicitly state "If you want to buy our drug, you have to promise not to use it to kill people." This is the reason that the US has had so many issues with lethal injection drugs recently; some cocktails have been disallowed by the manufacturers, and some of the new mixtures haven't been as thoroughly tested and aren't having the expected results. This is a guess, but I'd say the morphine manufacturing companies slapa sticker on the bottle that says "No executions, thanks!"
This is basically the brain releasing neurotransmitters like oxytocin which is normally only released when we are in love or when we feel safe/protected or are caring for children. Allegedly animals we find cute (cats/dogs) were selected for their "cuteness" over centuries but what makes them cute turns out to be the ratio/proportion/distance of their eyes and face face shape, which is nearly that of human children. So, in essence only human children were originally meant to elicit that feeling but we have created/found other things that also stimulate that part of the brain and thus sort of tricks us into finding it attractive/urge to protect it from harm. Baby animals are also like this and there have been citations of adult animals caring for young of other species probably also for similar reasons: their brains are sort of hardwired to instinctively care for "cute things" which babies of most species are.
You get the rest you need during REM sleep that takes about 90minutes to achieve and only for limited times Sleep consists of natural 90minute cycles. If you wake up naturally it will likely be at the end of the cycle and you aren't interupped and are well rested. An alarm will most likely wake you mid cycle and leave you feeling tired. Try sleeping in multiples of 90mins ( 1.5hr ,3hr ,4.5hr etc) and you'll notice yourself less tired when you wake, allow about 15mins to get to sleep when setting an alarm
They make a law saying they can't smoke weed outside of South Korea, and then they punish the offender upon their return. FWIW, this is called extraterritorial jurisdiction, and many countries have it. Most often it is used for things like piracy or terrorism, although sometimes you see it used for other things like sex tourism. The intent is that if something is illegal, you shouldn't be able to get away with it just because you stepped over an imaginary line on the ground. Whether these ideas can effectively be enforced is another matter entirely.
Guessing, but it's to make sure you can't come back in, collect the same goods as are on your receipt and leave with them a second time. If you try to leave with goods and a marked receipt, they know you're trying to steal them.
Temperature changes the flavor characteristics of food greatly. For example, cold makes you less able to taste properly compared to room temperature, in general. However, a lot of the draw of cool drinks is because it is a slight change on your system which is nice, like going from a snowy outside to a nice hot fire inside.
Severe taxation only works on complex goods that cannot be easily made or distributed to the black market. Cars are great example of goods that are not easily smuggled, replicated, or obtained outside of the white market. You cannot make one at home, you can I buy one from your drug dealer, and the state has a firm control on their use within the public sphere of roads. Bullets can be made at home, can be purchased on the black market, and thier ultimate use is normally not regulated in the public sphere. This means that while commercially available bullets could be taxed for law abiding citizens... Taxation of all munitions would never be an effective means of deterence, much like the current US policies against drugs. Edit: two major typos on cell.
Two main reasons: First, they're very light. The force of an impact is proportional to the mass of the object involved. Insects have very little mass, so they receive comparatively little force. It also means they have a low terminal velocity because the force of gravity pulling them down is more easily countered by air resistance. Second, they're armored. That doesn't seem consequential when you squish a bug, but on insect-scale the exoskeleton is quite strong, and it helps them minimize the impact of what force they do take from falling.
Because the people who are making barrels of money off the current system have a kick-ass PR machine.
It's not so important anymore, but in the early days of the internet, www. URL_1  was how you accessed the web page for  URL_1 , as opposed to  URL_0 , where you would access email for  URL_1  -- it was the subdomain for  URL_1  that indicated "There's a web page here"
Space is incredibly empty. I mean **incredibly** empty. As in, "so empty that the human mind cannot intuitively comprehend how empty it is". You have to **try** to hit things in space. If you just pick a direction and go, you'll almost certainly be able to leave the galaxy entirely without encountering anything more dense than a few molecules of gas. I think part of the blame for this misconception lies in how things like the asteroid belt are portrayed in popular media. We always see this giant conglomeration of rubble and boulders careening around and colliding with each other (or the poor spacecraft tasked with navigating through it). But in reality, if you were placed on a random asteroid in the asteroid belt, you'd need a telescope to be able to see even its nearest neighbors.
I know this one. It is not paint, is a diluted solution of slaked lime, and yes, to protect the trees from parasites.

Prior to the Nazi rise to power Germany was undergoing a push towards equal rights for homosexuals. Many men lived out lives and there were clubs and newspapers and other community oriented activities that were open about being for homosexuals. When the Nazis took power, these were the first people targeted. After that, identifying gay men proceeded much the same as it does in any country that oppresses homosexuality. People were outed to the authorities and punished. Some police forces set up undercover units.
In my city you also get something by mail to the registered address on the car. Failure to pay increases the fine and eventually it goes to collections. For us, parking citations are a civil violation and there's no possibility of criminal prosecution.
Not all latin food is spicy. I'm Argentinian and I can't think of spicy local food. This doesn't mean that there's not a trend in latin cooking, but it may be due to what you mentioned about availability. If you're American, then your experience may be biased by the latin food which is sold in the USA: Tex-Mex food is terribly spicy, more so than Mexican food in my experience.
It means they'll start testing new missiles and nuclear systems. The other parties to the treaty (most importantly the US) will probably start too. If it happens, you'll probably start seeing an increase in military development projects from both sides, along with more sabre rattling. However, it won't go any further than that.
So as someone who went from being a competitive gymnast to train in the circus with my goal of being in cirque (got injured so didn't make it). Very similar skills although there was some relearning of acrobatic technique to tumble on a hard surface/powertrak rather than sprung floor. Biggest difference is the artistry and creativity needed. As a competitive gymnast you learn to be very stiff and less fluid. Also bars has limited cross over to aerial silks/trapeze/lyra.
Not sure about specifics, but a general rule applies: People complain more than they thank.

You have actually hit the highlights pretty well. When the oil escapes the pot, it then goes down and hits the flame and catches fire. It doesn't so much is explode as burn very fast. I once worked a house fire that was caused by a turkey fryer accident in the sunroom. The house burned down within 30 minutes of the start of the fire. It was Christmas Eve.
Any answer to this is purely theoretical. Seems to be a real phenomenon though, at least based on the extent to which people report this effect Sauce: am arthritis doctor
Because being married is much more important for a women than a man, historically at least. Becoming Mrs. is a quick indication you're no longer available for courting to men.
Think of clock speed as the speed of an assembly line. You can speed up work by increasing the rate that the assembly line moves but this can only increase so fast before you start getting errors in the production from the workers (aka electronic components). You can also increase the production by improving the order that the work is completed so you no longer have certain workers waiting for work. You can also operate another set of workers on the same assembly line to get close to twice as much work done during the same time.
You are never a year older on February 28th. You are always a year older by March 1st. Every fourth year, you are older by February 29th.
The only restrictions are schools and parks: places where children are likely to congregate, especially unsupervised. Malls/stores are fine; as long as they aren't within the radius of a school/park.
They probably have a deal with Intel to push these heavyweight chips, and to maximize profit, they skimp on the other parts. They are basically relying on peoples' ignorance. Look at any computer sold at say, Best Buy. Sick i7 processor and a 2TB HDD? Probably has a piece of shit video card. Lower end processor and hard drive? Probably has 8GB of RAM. They basically use the expensive part as the selling point, and gloss over how terrible everything else is. It's all about money
My mom's family is friends with the Dierbergs family, a grocery store chain in St. Louis. Anyway, one Dierberg male, decided to be a secret service agent. When we was testing for it and training for it, they sent agents out to check his background. They questioned relatives, family friends, they went to his high school and questioned his high school teachers, this literally tracked down any person who would have an idea of who he was as a person. It's not just a "let's check the internet for criminal records" It's a "let's track down everybody who knew this guy and talk to them." kind of background check. This certain Mr. Dierberg ended up protecting Nancy Reagan while she was the First Lady, I believe.
They are actually right. Kilo = 1.000 = 10^3 Mega = 1.000.000 = 10^6 etc... Thats why the IEC "invented" binary prefixes that work as expected: Kibi = 2^10 = 1.024^1 = 1.024 Mebi = 2^20 = 1.024^2 = 1.048.576
Why do you think turboprops are obsolete in commercial aviation? Westjet recently bought a fleet of Bombardier Q400 turboprops for short-haul flights. They fly at considerably slower speeds than commercial jets, however, which would explain why they're less popular. I would argue though, that they aren't obsolete.
The process is called "Pulse oximetry". To simplify the way it works, the device which is placed somewhere on the body where the skin is thin, in your case the finger, and it emits specific light wave lengths, and its sensors detects what waves are being absorbed through the blood, giving them a fairly accurate approximation of the oxygenation of your blood.
Because when you eat, you're mushing it and mixing it with your saliva until it becomes a mushy soup of mushiness. For example, you can't shove a chocolate bar down your throat without gagging, despite it being food. An experiment you can do is to start eating something, but instead of swallowing you spit it out on a plate. It looks absolutely disgusting. But you will see the food is not solid at all anymore, it's like a mushy soup. And as we all know, swallowing soup isn't really an issue. Furthermore, we swallow things in steps, so to speak. If you put a lot of food in your mouth, you won't be able to swallow it all in one go (maybe some can). You will swallow it bit by bit, although you won't consciously think about it.
Because children are like little sponges that suck up every little bit of information they are exposed to, they also seek to emulate everything they perceive that grownups do. Finally they don't understand all the finer points of social etiquette, which is why they'll frequently do things like pick their noses or disrobe in public if you let them. If you let your kids be exposed to foul language or sex scenes, be prepared for many awkward situations that ensue when they start to emulate things they've witnessed or heard without understanding things like the context, consequences, social taboos and etiquette. A simple example: your kid witnesses you give your SO a passionate kiss. Later that night when you tuck them in and give them a kiss goodnight, they try and jam their tongue down your throat. They have no idea why that would be inappropriate.
I am surprised nobody has given you a correct answer yet. Forgive me for not pretending you are five. Let's say you are a billionaire. You have a billion dollars. You don't keep it all in cash under your mattress. In fact, you don't keep it in a savings account at a bank, either, at least not very much of it. Most of your billion dollars is actually something you own which is worth a billion dollars. Property, stock, mutual funds, etc. The way taxes work in the US, you don't pay taxes on what you own. You pay taxes on your income. That income could be from salary, or from a profitable investment. But investments are special, because there is no income until you sell them for more money than you initially paid for them. So let's say you own a billion dollars worth of mutual funds. Over the course of the year, it grows 8% in value. That is an 80 million dollar increase in value. But unless you sell some of it, there is no income, so there is no tax. You are 80 million dollars richer, but you have paid no taxes. Now, hang on a second. You do need some money to live on. Let's say a million dollars this year - that should be enough. So you sell a million dollars worth of this mutual fund you own. You will have to pay taxes on this. But not on a million dollars, just on the difference between what you paid for it and what you sold it for. Let's say the difference is 20% since you initially bought it a few years ago. You will pay taxes on $200k. Also, because this is a special kind of income called capital gains, you will pay a lower tax rate than if it were your salary. Instead of 30% or more, you will pay 20%. $40k. So, you are 80 million dollars richer this year. Your tax bill is $40 thousand dollars. Your effective tax rate was one twentieth of one percent. 0.05% Not 5%, not 0.5%. 0.05%. Edit: Fixed my math.
When we say we "look" at things that are very small, we don't mean we look with our eyes, not even with a very powerful microscope, we are looking at things that are smaller than the waves that make light. The equipment we use to look at these things is actually "feeling" around and drawing what it feels. We look at the drawings. Just like if I placed a ball on the floor and asked you to feel it very gently and draw what you felt on a piece of paper, you would probably move the ball a tiny little bit, even if you were very careful. So, when we are observing very small things, like it or not, we change them a little bit by feeling for them. If we didn't feel for them, they'd end up doing things a little bit differently. Slightly older than 5: it has to do with the wave/particle duality. A photon, for example, is a wave until it hits something, then it becomes a particle. When re-emitted, it becomes a wave again. If a photon hits our detector, it stops being a wave and stops following those physical laws and becomes a particle - following those laws instead. This is why observing the particles as they pass through the slits, borks what would happen if we simply just observed where they landed after going through the slits.
They want to protect the privacy of the vehicle owner and not get sued for the stupidest reason out there. Edit: /u/miopinions has it explained well.
Mine doesn't, but are you referring to Titanium Dioxide? -- this is a very common white pigment
Because everything in space (with mass) has a relative orbit and gravitational force. In fact, you even have a gravitational force. As the distance to a planet or star gets smaller, its gravitational pull gets stronger. Since the meteor already has a velocity vector (a magnitude and direction) it begins to accelerate towards the planet and it changes direction. So the meteor is still flying in its original direction and speed but now it's being pulled in another direction with additional speed. There are no fixed points in space so an object can't fly directly to a point. Every time it passes anything in space with mass it will move slightly towards it, depending on how much mass the meteor has and how much mass the object has. Imagine you're driving down a straight road doing 75 mph and ahead of you on the side of the road is a powerful magnet. As you get closer to passing the magnet, it's going to pull you towards it. So imagine that when you combine the speed and direction that you're already going with now a force pulling you sideways, you will tend to move you at an angle between the two. Much like how a meteor will enter the earth. Of course an object in space wouldn't have traction or frictional forces of the road but hopefully that helps makes sense of it.
No, because people are also being insured that don't pay for it, so rates are being raised (again) to cover those costs. This is why people were against the government interfering with health insurance in the first place. I'm a young man who doesn't smoke and is relatively healthy, but I can't afford health insurance at all. It shouldnt be like that. This is a really good system for people who get subsidies on their insurance, but for everyone else it's much more expensive than it used to be. In my family's case, my parents are paying over double for their insurance than they were a decade ago. Also, the cost of health care itself is going up, not 20% as many premiums are going up, but still rising. I'm fairly certain prescription drugs are also rising pretty dramatically.
Imagine I have some putty and a pencil. I put some putty on a table in a gob and then stick a pencil right in the middle of it. At first everything stays pretty much the same. The pencil stays upright and the putty doesn't really move. But after a couple of hours you would notice that the putty has drooped a little but and that the pencil is leaning just a little bit to the side. The hole from where you stabbed the putty is still fine though, it wraps around the pencil airtight. Next imagine I go to stand that pencil back up so that it's perfectly straight. When I do, I have to displace some of the putty out of the way from where I stabbed the pencil. Now instead of a perfect, pencil-sized, hole in my putty I have a slightly deformed oval. Now imagine the putty is your scalp and the pencil is a single hair on your head. Easy enough, right?
There's an oft cited statistic that women make 70% what men do or something like that, and people interpret it as meaning that women get paid much less for the same job. In fact that number is a comparison of average wages for all women vs. Average wages for all men. They don't get paid less for the same job, they just take lower paying jobs on average. Aside from the dearth of women in high level corporate positions, a lot of high paying professions like engineering and skilled trades are staffed mostly by men, which results in the overall disparity. But you can't really fire a guy and replace him with a woman with the same skills and experience and pay her significantly less.
Two animals are considered to be of different species if they can't produce fertile offspring. This isn't the case for people of different races. Furthermore, race is not considered a particularly meaningful category in biology.
We have. Humans and their ancestors spent millions of years on the dry plains of central Africa. Food was scarce and we've evolved to like calorie dense foods that best prepared us to survive food shortages. For most of human history slamming as much food as possible into your face *was beneficial*. Only recently has it become an issue due to an overabundance of high calorie food.
ELI5: In death scenes in movies do they ever just actually kill the actor? Haha, it's a movie. It's called acting. As far a boner goes, imagine *pretending* to have sex with a hot chick, but you're at work in front of your boss, all your co-workers, and even a few friends are watching you and critiquing your hump form, your body position, the director telling you to stop randomly because they have to adjust the sound or lights, etc. It wouldn't be as exciting as you may fantasize.
Bipolar 1 is marked with both -mania (brain going too fast). The chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine are at fault here at least partially. The person will be very "up". They may not need a lot of sleep, or not eat a lot. Their thoughts might race, and psychotic episodes can land them in hospital. These symptoms must last 7 days (or result in hospitalization) to be called a manic episode. -depression. This is because of a possible malfunction of serotonin receptors in the brain. The person may show all the signs of regular clinical depression. Bipolar 2 is marked with depression and hypomania, which is a less severe mania and must be present for 4 days to qualify for diagnosis. Children usually do not present with bipolar before the age of 15 or so, but it is still possible. Early onset bipolar usually involves rapid mood swings.
It's because of Megan's Law. A 7 year old child named Megan Kanka was raped and killed by a paedophile. He was a repeat offender. The family fought for sex offenders to be documented and for people to be able to see who lived nearby so they can protect their children. Her mother argued that if she had known a sex offender lived on their Street her daughter would have never been attacked. However, many studies show that it actually has no impact on the number of attacks. As to why no such list is in place for murderers. Most murderers do not reoffend. There isn't the public support for such a scheme. Source: am forensic psychologist
Hallo, Computer Scientist here. Bugs are almost never typos, they can be, but this is rarely the case as if you just misspell a variable, for example, your code simply won't compile. Basically, you push Go! and the computer just laughs at you in this case. More often in any kind of software, not just games mind you, the code interacts in a way that the programmer didn't expect. For example, the programmer thought that some variable, X, could _never_ be a negative number. Then, when the code (game, in our case) is running, it ends up being a negative number, and the code interacts in a way the programmer never expected it to. This normally happens at a large level because several, if not dozens or even hundreds, of programmers are all writing on the same code, meaning they cannot possibly account for every single thing that could go wrong. Consider that your average major title, like GTA, Skyrim, etc, can be hundreds of thousands, if not _millions_ of lines of code. It's easy for something to go wrong. If you have further questions, lemme know :D
No idea on the doctors for sure, but I'm guessing it's because they have to write an incredible amount very quickly over and over so they go for quantity over quality to ensure they get all the information rather than risk missing writing out something important. As for lefties, I can say for sure that there are a number of reasons. First and foremost, when we learn to write as children we are all taught the right-handed method of writing, which works fine for righties because it involves dragging the pen/pencil over the paper, but doesn't work for lefties because we have to push the pen/pencil over the paper instead. Most of us never learn any other way to write and so out handwriting is pretty awful as a result. Consider that in combination with the vast majority of desks in classes and such are all oriented automatically to the right for righties, which makes lefties have to reach all the way across our bodies to be able to write on them. Oh, and because we are pushing the writing utensils across the paper rather than pulling them we also have to deal with the side of our hands dragging across whatever it is we just wrote out, smudging it a lot. Just look at the heel of any lefties hand after hand writing an essay, you'll see what I'm talking about. Hope that helps!
Because Russia has huge landmass with very little ocean contact. Conversely, the southern hemisphere has a lot of ocean area with relatively little land. The ocean and its currents hold and move a lot of heat around the globe. Without proximity to the heat held in the ocean during the winter, Russia cools more drastically. On the other side, the southern hemisphere experiences smaller temperature swings with the seasons.
Those aren't undercover cops. They are just cops in unmarked cars. Generally police officers who aren't on patrol or doing traffic enforcement drive an unmarked car because it's less conspicuous. They aren't trying to hide, they just don't necessarily want to stand out or cause a commotion.
It has to do with the chemical structure of a Lithium battery. The way a lithium battery works is that during operation Lithium ions are removed from a lithium bearing compound from one contact, transferred across an electrolyte, and deposited on the other contact. When recharging, the process is reversed. The degradation comes from the fact that each time the cycle is performed, impurities are introduced into the structure of contacts, reducing their effectiveness.
How divisible a number is comes down to, how many prime factors it has. 100 is 2x2x5x5, or in other words, 2^2 x 5^2 360 is 2x2x2x3x3x5, or in other words, 2^3 x 3^2 x 5^1 Highly divisible numbers are useful. In the ancient times, due to whatever influences, base-60 systems were used because of their high divisibility, and although exact origin of 360 degree system is unknown, it's obviously related to the high number of prime factors it has. If you divide circle in three equal sectors, that's 120 degrees. If you divide it into 12 equal sectors, each of them are 30 degrees. If you divide them into 15 equal sectors, each of them are are 24 degrees. Half turn is 180 degrees. You get the point. Those times, base-10 was not really that universal. Base-10 really only become as dominant as we know it after 7th century when Indians came up with our Indian-Arabic number system. Clocks and circle division and stuff like that pre-date that by roughly thousand years or so. These systems have so much history, that despite the French trying to "fix" everything to use decimal, base-10 system during the French revolution, it really didn't go all that smoothly for all things. But yeah, nobody knows for sure, but the real obsession with having everything be base-10 only started at around 7th century(and while indian-arabic numerals were massively successful, it still took time for them to spread during pre-industrial times), before that we didn't really have numbers in the same sense that we have them, and things that don't use base-10 tend to pre-date that by a lot. Something between 100 BCE and 2000 BCE. Mathematicians actually don't use 360 degrees. They actually use 2 pi as the angle of circle, these units are called Radians(so 180 degrees = 1 pi radians). Reasoning for this is pretty different from why 360 is being used, but I thought this should be mentioned.
When you buy stuff with cash, (if not you, other people do) business will end up with a lot of money at the end of each day. They take the cash and deposit it in a bank so they can pay their debts and other business stuff. Banks will remove old or damaged bills and replace them with fresh new bills. No new money has entered the system, it's just traded out.
Because it's a fun, cute tradition. Seeing kida get all excited about santa is one of the most heart warming things on earth.
There's no legal mechanism to overturn a not guilty verdict - no amount of proof will do it. So essentially, a jury that decides they don't want to punish a criminal can just refuse to do so, even if shown video of him doing the deed and narrating a confession. If you tell a prosecutor that you've heard of this power and plan to use it, you're not likely to be selected.
I'm seeing a lot of misleading answers here, so -- as someone who teaches film in an English department -- I feel like I ought to speak up. When you look at theater, the written play (the "script") *is* the text. It's not written for one specific production, but rather it exists and may continue as the basis for multiple productions. When someone puts on a new production of Hamlet or Death of a Salesman, they go back to the same original script by Shakespeare or Miller and perform a new rendition of that same written work. Sure, every stage director may take some creative liberties, but rarely does one perform Hamlet and hire a new playwright to write an entirely new version of Hamlet. And when we refer to "Hamlet" as a historical piece of culture, we're referring to the written work of Shakespeare, not a specific performance of it. In cinema, however, the script is more like a blueprint, written as the basis for one specific production. When Steven Soderbergh remakes Ocean's Eleven, he doesn't go back to the same script used for the 1960 film (as we would with Hamlet on stage), but rather Warner Bros. hires a new writer to write an entirely new script written specifically for *this* production. If, in 40 years, we get another remake of the film, the producers would hire yet another screenwriter to make yet another new script for that production. We don't hold up the original script and feel any obligation to remake that specific collection of scenes and dialogue the way we do with a play. And so, in cinema, the film itself is the "text" that continues through the years. When we refer to "Ocean's Eleven" as a historical piece of culture, we are speaking of a specific film (we wouldn't say "Ocean's Eleven" to mean "that general story that Clooney and Sinatra and various other actors have performed at various times in various ways"). In short, when we talk about "Hamlet" as a cultural product, we're talking about a written text; the script is what lasts through the years. When we talk about "Ocean's Eleven" as a cultural product, we're talking about a specific produced film. And this is partly dictated by the nature of theater vs. cinema. There is no one performance of Hamlet (on stage) that lasts through the years; as a live performance, it doesn't have permanence. A stage performance is not a "thing" that we can keep. The script is what lasts over time; it's the "thing" that lasts. In cinema, on the other hand, the performance does last, recorded on celluloid (or a hard drive), such that the film becomes the "thing" that gets passed down through the years. Just like a building, we can go back and look at the original blueprints, and compare it to the final thing that was produced, but when we discuss architecture, we wouldn't hold up the blueprints for the Empire State Building as the "thing" in question -- we would look at the actual Empire State Building. EDIT: Got my first gilding on my cakeday. I feel like a grown-up redditor now. :D
Alcohol is what is produced when you take sugar and remove as many calories as you can from it without involving oxygen. As a result it still contains a lot of the calories that the initial sugar had.
The US has a large economy and far reaching economic interests. This puts it in conflict with almost anything ~~nasty~~ contentious on the planet, as somehow it impacts their interests. Switzerland has a relatively narrow set of economic interests (banking) that encourage neutrality in conflicts. They also benefit by being close to powerful countries with a vested interest in protecting them from attack. This allows them to be protected by proxy.
The federal government was designed to primarily be a representative of the States, while the States would represent the People. This is apparent in how the Federal Senate was initially chosen by the state legislatures (prior to a constitutional ammendment), and the Electoral College was initially also selected independent of the popular vote (that's screwy ATM because of state-level laws). Indeed, the House of Representatives still gets 0 say in federal nominations, appointments, or treaties. As the State governments were viewed to be much closer and more relevant to the People, their state constitutions generally reflected this in directly voting in many more positions.
As other people have said, statute of limitations. Is this injustice? Some may think so, but there are very good arguments that it is not. Imagine that the status of every piece of property, everywhere in the world, could be called into question, with its current owners called up to pay for the crimes of their ancestors centuries ago. Where would it end? Could the descendants of the Romano-Celts in Britain sue the Saxons? Could the Saxons sue the Normans? Could one American Indian tribe be sued by another for something that happened before European colonization? A functioning system of property rights requires that a cutoff point be established, beyond which no appeals can be made. (The moral basis for this principle is that someone living today is not responsible to the victims of his ancestors many generations ago.) In a capitalist system, this turns out to be the best for everyone, as anyone who "unjustly" starts off with more than his ability would grant him, because his ancestors were conquerors, gradually sinks down to the mean level of wealth, just as the aristocrats in Europe gave way to the capitalist *nouveau riche*. Furthermore, the Indian tribes' claims to "ownership" of land were very often invalid, as the land was not owned by individuals, but "collectively", and was often not developed, but simply roamed over (however, there were exceptions, such as the Cherokees, who Westernized but were still unjustly deported). For more on this issue, I recommend pg. 317 of George Reisman's [Capitalism]( URL_0 ), available for free online.
It's a form of protection for the accused. There can actually be a long time between arrest and trial and there is only one way to guarantee that the accused shows up to trial: jail them in the interim. Since a person not yet tried is technically innocent, and since this interim period can be long (and historically has been used to jail people indefinitely), we have the option of releasing them until the trial. But we still need a way to ensure they show up for trial, so we have bail. They pay money that the court keeps until they show up for trial. If they show up, they get the money back, if not, they lose the money (and get other crimes added to their charges, to boot). The more severe the crime, the more severe punishment the accused faces, and the greater incentive is needed for them to appear to face that possible punishment, so we have higher bails for those crimes. EDIT: Some answers to common replies: 1. Yes you can get the money back even if you are guilty, but the government will take from that fees, fines and other penalties. Since it's money you would owe anyway, them taking it out of money they are already in possession of is the same thing as giving you all the money back and then just taking the money anyway. 2. It is not a loan. It is collateral. You do not get interest and it is not adjusted for inflation. 3. Yes, this is just one of many aspects of the US criminal justice system that hurts poor people more than rich people. It is not the only aspect nor the aspect that hurts poor people the most. 4. People that cannot afford bail outright (almost everyone) can use a bail bondsman. This is a person or company that will pay your bail for you, but the price of that is they permanently keep 10% of that fee. So if your bail is $50,000, you pay the bail bondsman $5,000 and they will foot the rest of the bill to the government. So you are permanently out $5,000 as opposed to being temporarily out $50,000. If you skip trial (meaning the bondsman loses their money) they will hunt you down and find you and not be very friendly about it. EDIT2: Update from /u/wickedogg regarding bond bailmen:  >  As an attorney who works for a bail bondsman, hunting people down is not the main consequence of skipping trial. The main thing that we do is go after the people who agreed to guarantee the bail. The accused (to use your term) needs someone to go to the bondsman for him and usually that person is a parent, or uncle, or other family member. That person signs a guarantee and a confession of judgment along with providing a detailed accounting of all their assets, job, and personal information. When the bail gets forfeited I file the judgment and take the money out of bank accounts, garnish wages, and take property. All of this is motivation for the family to make sure that the accused shows up in court in the first place, or turns himself in soon after skipping a court date.
It was less about ideology and more about rivalry. The US and the USSR were struggling for global dominance. Since communism and capitalism were largely incompatible, they were useful tools to force countries to pick one side or the other, and to stay on that side once it was picked. If instead of Russia, communism had taken hold in say, Greece or Argentina, the US probably wouldn't have cared nearly as much.
Lucky for you, your ear has a protective barrier called your tympanic membrane (eardrum). This keeps the middle and inner ear separated from the outside environment. Even if your eardrum gets torn, your body has a connection from the ear to the throat known as your Eustachian tube so if you were to go swimming with a perforated eardrum (a bad idea since the risk for infection skyrockets), you'd still be alright.
The telecom industry has made significant donations to help elect or re-elect many, many Congressmen. The telecom industry also stands to lose a huge amount of money if net neutrality continues. The Congressmen, who want to continue to receive their donations, are fighting against net neutrality to save their donors' wallets.
It isn't universal, but it IS extremely common across cultures, with by far the majority of cultures sharing a head nod as an indication of acceptance or agreement and a head shake indicating refusal or disagreement. One of the common theories as to why this may be is that it comes from how babies use body language to indicate things before they speak. When they are searching for a nipple to latch on to to get food they will scan up and down, and when they want to refuse food they will move their head to the side.
**ELI5: Probably because it looks better.** Once *I* became a single letter (originally it was normally spelt *ic*) it gradually grew taller because (and I suppose this is conjecture) it didn't look very good. Originally it was not capitalised and it is a trend that started at the end of the 1300s (i.e. when Chaucer wrote The Canterbury Tales) and has stuck. Edit: As /u/proudlom points out [in his comment below]( URL_0 ) there is no definitive answer to this question.
Its just fun watching the wonder and amazement in there little faces, then they talk about it for weeks prior and post. And it is always fun tricking your kids. It is funny you bring up spirituality, because after the Santa game is up the kids start to think about what else is not real, and it is hard keeping God on the real list when Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy drop off.
10% comes from the whole amount, but a company only makes a margin of profit. Let's say I sell thingies. A thingie costs me $8 to manufacture (or that's what I pay for it wholesale) and I sell it for $10. My goal each month is to sell 100 thingies which gives me a $200 profit ($2 per thingie) If I give a 10% discount to a customer and sell it for $9, and I sell 100 thingies, my profit is $100. I've lost half of my money. I will need to sell 100% more thingies just to get back to where I was before a 10% discount.
They'd love to, but they can't. Too dangerous to do it by hand- I remember one attempt at doing so led to the deaths of the 7 attempted recoverers, and you can't do it by machine because the mountain is either too steep, to windy, or the air too thin for helicopters to fly. The engines would suffocate from lack of oxygen or be unable to get off the ground because the blades couldn't push enough air down. Or both. And finally, because money. You got any idea how expensive it is to climb Everest? It's pricey and hard enough as is without 200+ pounds of literal dead weight on your back.
Films that were shot on real film (35mm) can be scanned again and a HD copy be made for BluRay release. You see, film is great. Really great. So great, that even today, Digital Cinematography cameras like the RED One, Epic, Phantom, Cinealta, Arri, Panavision and such are trying to keep up with what film can really do. Film captures a great detail of grays and very natural colors, and despite the fact that is was created more than 100 years ago, film is still the bar used to measure digital equipment. So film is better than HD 1080p, as a matter of fact, digital projectors in theaters are about 4K resolution in order to keep up with what film could do. I have not shot a single foot of film for four years. Digital Cinematography it's getting there, and the speed and price of the process works in favor of digital. Hope it helps EDIT: Added Arri
An interesting phenomena, it is because the brain doesn't store what you saw during the time your eye spent moving, instead the brain fills in this time with what you saw when you stopped moving your eye. Wikipedia has an article on [chronostasis and the stopped clock illusion] ( URL_0 ) if you want to read about it.
While it varies from person to person, there's a general sort of "ideal" body form that humans have evolved to favor. Back in our hunter-gatherer days, a decent amount of muscle was likely very useful for survival, and a decent amount of fat was likely handy to have just in case of tough times. But eventually you get to a point of diminishing returns. Having enough muscle mass to be able to bench press 200 pounds might be a great trait for a hunter-gatherer human. But does increasing that muscle mass to the point where you could bench 400 pounds make you twice as good at hunting or gathering? Probably not. But all of that extra muscle mass does require more energy input in order to maintain. (You need to eat more). You get to a point where, in terms of survival in the natural world, more muscle is a bigger liability than a benefit. Your amount of body fat has similar tradeoffs. Obviously having 300 lbs of fat would make life as a hunter/gatherer difficult in a bunch of ways. But having very little fat reserves would leave you very vulnerable in times of scarce food. In terms of natural survival, there's absolutely no reason why a decently fed human body would ever want its fat percentage to drop to lower digits. When you're trying to get your body fat percentage really low, or bulk up your muscle mass really high, you're fighting against your body's natural inclination. You're forcing it to do things that, for the majority of human history, would reduce its chances of survival.
Persians are an ethnicity within Iran. Not all Iranians are Persians. It's like saying your are English when you are of British descent or saying that you are Inuit if you are of Canadian descent.
From what I understand the process of harnessing the hydrogen from water is incredibly expensive. It's a big part of the reason hydrogen cars never took off.
First off, let's be clear that we're talking about a link between poverty and obesity in the U.S. and not in some third world country. We don't have food scarcity issues (generally) that cause famine and/or mass starvation. First off, it is expensive to eat healthy and preparing healthy well-balanced meals for your family only works if you have the time and means to do so. In poor urban areas, it is much cheaper and easier to hit up the McDonald's dollar menu, get a big tray of chicken and rice from a food stand, or go to the grocery store whose shelves are loaded with enriched, unhealthy, processed crap. There aren't very many Whole Foods' or farmer's markets in these neighborhoods and poor people who are working multiple part-time jobs dont' generally take the time to travel to more affluent neighborhoods to buy food. Then there's the portion-size issue. Portion sizes have grown in the past 20 years at fast food restaurants and also in stores. Poor people want to get the most for their dollar, so they buy bigger, get the super-sized fries, etc... On top of that, we teach/pressure our kids to "finish their plates." There's more pressure when the $ you used to put that food on the plate is more scarce. We're also talking about lots of single-parent households, fractured schedules, etc.. Lot of eating "on the go" or with minimal preparation which lends itself to more unhealthy options. And lastly, exercise. Really poor kids get less exercise, and tend to have parents who are less involved in making sure they get it. That's why physical education curricula in public schools is so important (even though we make fun of gym class in affluent suburbs).
Sublingual (under the tongue) administration does bypass the stomach, obviously, but all of your blood will eventually pass through the liver (via the hepatic artery). However, unlike substances absorbed in the stomach and small intestine (oral administration into the hepatic portal vein, which brings everything through the liver first), medication administered sublingually goes to the heart *first*, then on to the liver if it happens to travel inferiorly (downward). This is why nitroglycerin is administered sublingually to treat angina pectoris (cardiac-related chest pain). [Source]( URL_0 )
Telecom operators benefit from spoofed caller id, it leads to more calls. Network operators use the return IP to send answers back, so spoofing it doesn't get you any data. They mostly check for spoofing because it's a symptom of evil. Telecom operators are evil, so it's not on their list of problems to solve.
There's a small ~~turbine~~ impeller (a special kind of high powered fan) in the base which sucks air up from the base and pushes it through holes in the edge of the ring (the entire ring is hollow). The air being pushed through the edge of the ring sucks even more air through the middle. [Here's a diagram of the insides]( URL_0 ) Edit: Actually it's an impeller (thanks for the clarification guys), turbine = anything that collects power from a moving gas/liquid.
You measure the circumference of your ribcage just under your breasts, then you measure around at the fullest at your breasts. Now there are two methods of calculation. One tells you to subtract the ribcage measurement from the breast measurement, the other tells you to add 2-4 inches to the ribcage measurement. This is because decades ago when stretchy materials like Lycra didn't exist, you need to add some inches to the band in order to be comfortable. So most modern day bra manufacturers (at least in the US) use the modern method. Let say your ribcage measurement is 34 and breast measurement is 38. You subtract 38-34 = 4. The ribcage measurement will be the band size (so it's 34) and every inch difference will be one cup up (if you get 1 inch difference you have A cup, 2 inch difference you have B cup. In our example the difference is 4 inches, so congratulations you have D cup boobs). Our bra size is 34D. It might be a little confusing when you get to more than 5 inches in difference. Back in the 50's the biggest cup available was D (I guess they didn't foresee breast implant become popular or people getting fatter), so when they realized they need to make even bigger cup sizes, they just add an extra D thinking boobs cannot possibly get any bigger (most old ladies at the time wore one-piece corslettes, bra was something younger and slimmer women would buy). When they needed to make yet bigger cups, some manufacturers decides to make DDD and others decides to go up one letter to E. There isn't a standard on cup sizing beyond DD so some bras cups will be A-B-C-D-DD-DDD-E while other bras cups will be A-B-C-D-DD-E-F. (I've noticed DDD is more common in the US while DD-E is more common in the UK). Take note though, finding the correct sizing is only the beginning. Bra manufacturer may or may not make the bra according to the size or make bras that's just not suitable for your shape. Therefore it's very important to try several different sizes/styles on and learn what's the best design for you.
OH MY GOSH, some of my useless chem knowledge can come into play. What other people have said is close, but not entirely correct. You're not using friction per se to just "rub off" the graphite. What is happening is actually a solubility between two nonpolar solid substances, the rubber and the graphite. So the London dispersion forces (really weak intermolecular forces) between these molecules are attracted to each other and as you rub and create heat it increases the attraction and removes more graphite from the paper as it is attracted to the rubber. That's why you get dirty rubber dust. That's also why your lead sticks to paper to begin with, those same London dispersion forces are attracting the lead to the paper. Those forces are actually a little stronger than attraction between the graphite and the rubber which is why you have to put a little energy into getting it all out. ☺ Edit: I was so excited I forgot to answer your question completely. Erasers are made out of rubber because it is a nonpolar solid material which attracts other nonpolar solids, like graphite. The way it is malleable and crumbles (like others mentjoned) makes it less abrasive to the paper itself. Edit 2: Rubber being nonpolar is also why it is an insulator and does not conduct electricity. Wooooo! SCIENCE! Edit 3: Thanks for the gold!! Can someone ELI5 to me what I do with it?! (Can't wait for all the unecessarily advanced explanations 😋🙃) Edit 4: Whoa, my dudes. Did not expect my highest comment to be about sciencey wiencey erasers! This gal needs to go finish her homework and break away from the Reddit vortex, though. I need to make corrections on the rubber/conductivity (Edit 2- defo some misleading info) and will do it at some point later tonight! Thanks to all who shared their questions and knowledge! Hope you guys are all off sciencing now! ☺
The "second wind" is typically your body releasing a stress hormone called Cortisol, triggered by a stress like lack of sleep, overexertion, etc. Cortisol does 2 primary things. - Releases your stored glucose, or robs some protein from your muscles to convert into glucose if you have not eaten adequately, in order to raise your blood sugar levels so your muscles have fast energy available. - Pushes blood through the body more quickly by restricting the arteries and raising your heart rate. These give you the feeling of a "second wind", allowing your body to manage the physical stress you are putting on it (fight or flight). This response is fine and not bad by itself, but the problems come when you don't deal with the stress and let your body rest properly, and end up damaging your body by keeping that negative feedback loop going so that it remains in a constant state of high blood sugar and/or high blood pressure.
Stainless steel is less likely to be affected by foods and liquids that stain or leave residual odors, and it's less likely to be damaged by heat, heavy cookware, metal utensils, and abrasives used for cleaning.
They may have more. Police often dont divulge all information. For instance if police told everyone they knew they drove a red truck, they would ditch the truck.
Their export surplus come from exporting more than they import... Germany exports lots of Mercedes, BMWs, Karl Zeiss camera lenses, pharmaceuticals, high value industrial machinery, as well as wines, beer, etc. And then there are services like banking, consulting, engineering. It's not a problem for the global economy... in fact its a benefit as the world gain access to excellent products. Imbalances can cause currency fluctuations and countries may try to slow imports from Germany to help their domestic industries.
Sugar is a molecule made of a particular arrangement of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. When you heat up the sugar, this adds energy to the system that can be used to fuel chemical reactions that rearrange the bonds between these atoms. Some of these compounds are dark brown in color and add caramel flavors to the sugar. Similar reactions occur in meat when you cook it and get a tasty brown crust.
Because the State of Florida has EXTREMELY extensive government transparency ("Sunshine") laws, where reporters have access to large quantities of governmental, police (arrest information, court proceedings, etc), and such information. So it's pretty much just a matter of fishing for the strangest stories. Also, American Media, the publisher of most of the tabloids in America, is based in Florida, which means a lot of "local color" stories ends up getting published as national news.
France had the most advanced space agency outside of the US or USSR at the time. They were the third country to design a satellite launcher, and the third country that put an [animal into space]( URL_0 ). The Space Race usually refers specifically to the feud between the US and USSR. But France was heavily involved in the space sciences at the time.
Am Swedish, can inform. As mentioned, a majority of our entertainment is in English, and is subtitled, not dubbed. This means that we're exposed to it from a very, very young age. Also, formal education in English is started from year 3 in school (might have changed since I was that young though). Back when I was educated, all education was in "the queens English" and not the American variety. Last, which is a bit trickier to explain, is that the "sounds" that make up the Swedish language includes all (and many more) "sounds" in the English language. Meaning, it's much easier for a Swede to properly pronounce English than vice-versa. ("sounds" is properly called "phonetics")
Task fatigue. The exact, molecular mechanisms of what is happening inside your brain is not completely understood but essentially the process in your brain that stops it from paying attention to other stimulus and only on the task at hand, in this case studying and not looking at Reddit, gets physically tired and looses effectiveness. The father you push this mechanism without recovery, just like a muscle, the less effective it becomes. Read more about it here:  URL_0 
In your brain, you possess something known as the I-function. The I-function is something that is known to act as a screen between reality and what we perceive as reality. Hallucinating people have trouble differentiating between the two because their I-function distorts reality and what we perceive as reality. The I-function relies on neurons to be effective. When you are awake for extended periods of time, your neurons do not get a break. As neurons become more taxed, a person has a difficult time differentiating between reality and what is perceived as reality, causing hallucinations. Water also provides energy for neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurotransmitters relay signals between neurons in the brain. Without proper energy, neurotransmitters can misfire, resulting in the brain making you believe it is being stimulated when in reality there is nothing there, causing you to hallucinate. I've been researching this topic for about an hour, and there's not much info, but this is what I could find and infer.
I'm sure I'm going to be downvoted to hell for this, but the reason it seems like people are apathetic to it probably has something to do with the UVA situation. Not that specific example, let me explain. A girl tells a story, a truly horrifying story that would disturb any normal person. She seems trustworthy enough, so it is believed as fact, life is disrupted for people who had nothing to do with it and people are punished. As the weeks go on people find a hole in the story, and another, and another. Low and behold the girl who cried rape had shown an old picture of a fellow high school student she hasn't seen in years as the main perpetrator of the rape. Now her whole story sounds sketchy. In a perfect world, nobody would be raped, in a simple world we could believe everyone who said they'd been raped. But the fact of the matter is that people are crazy, some crazy people do the raping, some crazy people lie about being raped to fuck with somebody, or just for the attention. The people who advocate rape are just fucked up.
The best tl:dr for white privilege I've ever heard is this: Life can be hard if you're white. But life is never hard *because* you are white.
Most of your question has been answered but here is another part that wasn't. All GPS satellites are owned and operated by the US Air Force. They maintain these systems and provide their signal for free use to anyone in the world who wants to "listen". A big radio station in the sky, all you need to do is tune in to hear it.
Okay, all of these answers are incorrect. The introduction of the metric system in Canada was a phased process that started in 1976. Because it was phased, certain things changed before others. In 1984, Mulroney was elected and disbanded the commission, so no further metrification took place. If it was done already it remained in metric, if not, it remained in imperial. Hence, you drive 50km/h but weigh 185lbs. It's 20C outside but 350F in your oven. Canada is a massive dog pile of measurements because baby boomers didn't care to see through a full conversion to metric. People almost got killed over this. See: Gilmi glider. It's really something that should be re-instituted so that we can fully convert. EDIT: See here:  URL_0 
Long story short: there are numerous security companies in China whose work primarily consists of attempting to breach foreign companies' databases, some directly on behalf of the Chinese government, some just to sell the information to the highest bidder (oftentimes the Chinese government anyway). As for the history that led to that point, my knowledge is a little shaky since it's been a while since I've seriously read literature on the subject, so take the following with a grain of salt. Cyber attacks and information theft are official policy of the PRC, intended to strengthen the country. As for why there are so many, that's because China simply has more hackers. From the 1990s to around 2005, China had a large community of patriotic computer hackers who operated independently or in non-government-affiliated groups, yet with the tacit consent of the government (this had to do with their philosophy, which emphasized the role of the everyday citizen in the betterment of the country). Around 2005, the Chinese government switched its stance and began cracking down on unsanctioned hacking. Most of the hackers either quit causing trouble, or legitimized into security companies so that they could continue to operate with the approval of the Chinese government. The government itself also operates several military units dedicated to hacking as well, but those are probably less relevant to you (assuming you don't work for a defense contractor or military R & D company). Incidentally, do you know the time stamps for the attempted logins? The security companies in China tend to operate on a 9-5 schedule, Beijing time. EDIT: If anyone's interested, here are some relevant readings: * *The Dark Visitor - Scott Henderson* - Silly cover aside, it details the history of the Chinese hacking community and how it has evolved. * *Mandiant's APT1 report* - A little more technical, but also talks about the role of the Chinese military in CNO, primarily the infamous Unit 61398. I think this one is pretty well known.
When you wash your hands, you also wash off the soap. If you do happen to ingest some residual soap, it will be a very small amount.
I wrote up a very detailed (perhaps too detailed) history of Watergate in this sub last year. [Here it is.]( URL_0 ) In very abbreviated form: * Under the auspices of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP), Nixon's executive staff (incl. his Chief of Staff, Attorney General, and others) used campaign donations as a slush fund to run a "dirty tricks" operation to harass political opponents via forging letters, planting provocateurs at political rallies, etc. * Although the CREEPs didn't brief Nixon on the details of their operations directly, he knew that CREEP was a dirty tricks shop, who ran it, and the kinds of actions they took, and was briefed on at least some operations after the fact. * CREEP authorized a burglary of Democrstic headquarters in order to secretly (and illegally) tap their phones, located in The Watergate Hotel. (It's really a hotel/apartment/office building.) * The burglars got caught, and they had the names and contact info of WH staff on them, as well as a $25,000 campaign donation cashiers check in their bank accounts. * After the burglary, the CREEPs briefed Nixon about it. * Nixon held a press conference in which he falsely denied knowing anything about it, falsely claimed he had assigned WH Counsel John Dean to investigate, and falsely claimed Dean found no connection to the WH. * Nixon publicly ordered the FBI to investigate, but privately ordered them not to look too thoroughly. This was obstruction of justice, a felony. * He also secretly ordered the CIA to interfere with the FBI investigation, which is also obstruction of justice. * He later ordered various staffers to lie to the grand jury investigating Watergate, which is perjury. Yet more obstruction of justice. * As a result of the investigation, it came out that there was a secret taping system recording conversations in the Oval Office. Nixon tried to fire the Watergate special prosecutor when he demanded the tapes, and ultimately also fired the new Attorney General and Assistant AG when they refused to fire the prosecutor. ("The Saturday Night Massacre.") * Eventually Nixon handed over the tapes, which showed all the lies and obstruction of justice mentioned above, as well as the essentially immoral and illegal purpose of CREEP. The tapes also showed that Nixon routinely suborned the FBI, CIA, and IRS to investigate and persecute his political opponents and members of the press. * There is an 18 and a half minute gap in the tapes, which no one has ever explained. Given that the WH did turn over multiple instances of the president suborning oerjury, siccing federal agencies on private citizens, and obstructing justice, what could possibly have been so bad that they had to destroy it? Impeachment motions had been in the House already, but after the tapes, everybody knew it was a matter of time, and Nixon resigned. Ultimately 49 people went to jail for their participation in Watergate and CREEP, including the burglars, Nixon's Chief of Staff, several other Exec staffers, the former Attorney General, John Dean, etc. Prosecutors were very seriously considering pursuing Nixon himself for obstruction of justice; if they had done so, he would have almost certainly been convicted based in the evidence of the tapes. But President Ford pardoned Nixon as one of his first official acts. And so Nixon lived out his days in California, unmolested.
They're not. They are, however, one of our chief competitors. So they're our bad guys. Just the same, we're their bad guys.
napoleon was actually not very civil with his tactics. War was in many ways considered a game for rulers. Armies would push and move and claim territory without many men dying. often men would line up and enter the field (lines were tactically the best for ranged warfare) and fire at each other until one side's discipline broke or their general could see they would not win today and withdraw. Injuries were regular, and so were deaths, but not hundreds a day like movies portray. there were rules of engagement and to break these rules for a victory was unsporting and would bring ridicule...there was no honour in stabbing a sleeping man. Ambushes were tactical and the fault of the enemy for not being prepared, and so not dishonorable. Even in retreat men should walk backwards and face the enemy for to run with your back turned was cowardly. napoleon was considered ungentlemanly in the way he conducted his troops to attack baggage lines, strike from behind or at night, he also did not battle in lines, but in columns and destroy the enemy like a battering ram. Napoleon was not there to play games, he was there to win...and he was very good at it until the others caught up. EDIT: in the civil war era battle was disastrous and thousands of men died each battle, because this was also not a game of gentlemen like the hundred year war, or war of roses, or the trinity wars, or the 7 years war, much of the Spanish conquest and so on. The reason the these wars were organised was because strategic points are quite clear to both sides. If there is a river crossing, one side is attacking and one is defending. when the attackers move, the defenders have time to react...often hours. There are no jeeps and APCs to move men, they move at walking speed. and when you know the rage of your opponents you can gather your troops outside this range into formations and march them forward.
We were the first country to fully adopt Enlightenment principles of individual freedom and what not. However, today we're really not any better than other Western counties
It's both learned and related to development. All mammals have the instinct not to "soil the nest". We mostly train our babies out of this instinct by putting them in diapers and being totally oblivious to their signals that they want to pee, but it's possible to keep it going - there is a thing called Elimination Communication which is one of those "parenting movements" with an awful name but effectively, it's a googleable phrase which means you can find information about how to watch your infant for signs they are about to pee or poop and "catch" it in a little pot instead of using a diaper. This is also common practice in some non-Western cultures. Of course, if you want to do it at night you have to sleep in very close proximity to the infant. But doing this even very young babies will wake at night to pee and then go back to sleep. So partly we train them out of it and then have to train them back into it again when we potty train. What happens when potty training is that toddlers are learning to associate the feelings of a full bladder/bowel with the imminent arrival of pee, and control the muscles around the urethra to hold it long enough to get to a toilet first. Children sleep much more deeply than adults - they tend to sleep through noise, for example, much more easily - and it's common that for some time during and after potty training they are either not aware enough of the nerve endings around the bladder to pay attention to them even during sleep or they are just too deeply asleep to notice these sensations. Once they become more accustomed to paying attention to these signals, they'll be more likely to wake up, assuming they are not too deeply asleep. Secondly, the hormone part somebody mentioned below is also true but it's not strictly related to why we wake up, more the amount of pee created. The adult body produces a hormone called ADH (antidiuretic hormone) during sleep which tells the body to produce less urine during this time, meaning that adults rarely produce enough urine at night to get into a desperate enough state to wake us up. When we do, it's likely unusual enough that this is a significant factor as well. For children who haven't started producing this hormone yet (the exact age varies, but girls tend to develop it a couple of years earlier than boys, which is why boys are more likely to suffer from bedwetting for longer), the feeling of having a full bladder at night wouldn't necessarily be unusual meaning it's less likely to wake the child up. Lastly there is the simple fact that adults tend not to be afraid of the dark and additionally are much more aware of where their limit for *actually* peeing themselves is, whereas children might delay getting out of bed because they are cold, scared, or just sleepy and they don't have as good of a handle on that tipping point yet because they don't have as much experience. (This is the same reasoning for why young children sometimes hold on so long that they just pee themselves because they were too busy playing or didn't know that they didn't have enough time to get to the toilet, whereas this rarely happens to adults without incontinence issues.) But again, this isn't strictly the same situation since you mentioned **waking**.
They didn't. Their feet developed calluses, thicker and harder skin, which meant that they didn't get hurt as badly from stepping on stuff. Your feet are only as vulnerable as they are because you protect them with shoes all the time. There are barefoot runners even today with callus-armored feet.
Two reasons: * WiFi typically operates at 100 mW, cell phones are allowed to transmit up to 2000 mW. * WiFi operates at a higher frequency, which is blocked more easily by walls, etc. These are intentional. Wifi links have been established by hobbyists using souped- up routers over long distances (miles), but that defeats the purpose of home use, because if all routers reached that far, they'd all interfere with each other, making the connection slow.
You'd have to replace the skin, skeleton, brain, blood vessels... they all age.
I'll explain as best I can but to answer I need to explain a bit about how the insurance payments work. TL; DR: Doctors don't have to accept insurances that they feel don't pay them enough or are too difficult to deal with. Your question about doctors that have retired..... that's on the insurance company itself. The insurance system we have in America is really screwy. I'm sure you have seen images and stories about hospitals and doctors charging several hundred dollars for a brace or Tylenol or whatever. Now, we all know that a brace doesn't cost $200, but payments made for supplies and drugs are hiked up to make up for the small (proportionally) fees that are paid to doctors. What is billed to insurance (and to the patient without insurance) is not what the insurance company pays. Most of the values billed are based on the Medicare rates. Then the insurance companies deal with hospitals and groups a % of what the insurance will pay. You will occasionally see on a medical bill something like "Total Charge submitted : $100,000 (just making up numbers)........ Insurance write off : $40,000....... Account settled : $60,000. So insurance paid 3/5 of what is "charged", and most of that money doesn't go to the doctor.... it's for overhead. Example, a carpal tunnel release surgery will pay the surgeon about $55 (from Medicare). Now, to you or me, $55 might sound like a fair amount of money, but after the costs of Malpractice insurance, taxes, and the time and money spent to become a surgeon..... it's not much at all. So, the compensation for doctors is fairly low at the NET level. This is even more true with Primary Care Doctors. A PCP has to have front desk staff, nurses/medical assistants, some kind of billing department, an office (in a medical building or campus) and a host of other costs that are really unavoidable. People/staff required wages that they can live on and that is going up all the time and the doctors can't raise their rates to meet this. So if the rate paid by the insurance is too low..... the doctor won't accept it. Now, some insurances will pay more to the doctors. Some insurances will challenge any charge by the doctor and make the doctor justify the charge/order to another doctor on the insurance companies payroll. The harder it is to get the money out of the insurance company, the more time is required to work on these conferences, the more paperwork required, the less likely the doctor will accept the insurance. Problems like these can also happen with different types of policies from the same insurance companies. So a doctor will take Cigna plans A, B, and D but not plan C. I hope that gives you some understanding of why they won't accept your insurance. *EDIT* : THANK YOU random redditor! I've never gotten gold before. P.S. This is as basic overview, It can get really convoluted due to the amount of regulation and differing standards.
ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a non-profit that was founded in '98 to handle the reserving of names for websites. Before ICANN, it was literally handled by [some dude]( URL_1 ). If you wanted a unique website name you had to contact that dude. That was becoming unsustainable so everyone got together and decided on some rules. When you pay for a domain name, some of that money is going to ICANN for operational costs and some of it goes to the registrar (like GoDaddy). The reason some domain names cost more than others is simply because they are more desireable. They work a bit like stocks. So " URL_0 " is going to cost more to register than " URL_2 " because there are probably more people that want it. Supply and demand. EDIT: Hey guys. I know that Postel was not just "some dude". But this is ELI5. I was just trying to give some background without going on a tangent or getting complicated. Which is why I linked to his Wikipedia page. Also, ICANN was not created because Postel died. The US government was discussing alternatives back in '97 - well before his death. A bigger reason for the creation of ICANN was probably that time Postel decided to change the root zone server of most of the Internet to his own server without telling anyone (again, ELI5). That freaked a lot of people out.
They had. There are various herbs that when eaten, made a woman miscarry and ancient (we are talking even before Rome) people also had other means of performing abortion. As for first condoms, they were made from animal gut, or fine leather, or oiled silk or various other materials and were reusable. EDIT: Typo
Not a matter of muscles but of controlling them. We don't know the right nerves to trigger in order to get the muscles to do what we want.
1/3 = 0.333333333 repeating. 0.333333333 repeating x 3= 0.99999999 repeating. 1/3 x 3 = 1 Therefore 0.999999999 repeating = 1
This is a very interesting question. I would argue that the bombings of abortion clinics by Christian groups fall under Terrorism since it is defined as the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. So, if the killing of someone or group of people is to affect political change (in this case, the use of holy — christian or muslim — imagery in a manner they disagree with), then yes, it would fall under the basic premise of terrorism.
If they were a punk rock band it likely wouldn't have mattered. But the Country Music fan base skews very republican and highly patriotic. So they basically shot their own fan base in the foot. It would have been like the band Phish coming out in favor of high mandatory minimums for first time pot possession and claiming all users of recreational drugs are a blight on american society. Free speech.... but might have been particularly scorned by their particular fan base.
One thing to remember is that buildings are continually being torn down. What remains are the best examples of architecture and design from times past. That gives us a distorted picture of what things were really like back then. There have always been bland, unsound, ugly, cheap buildings put up. Those generally don't last (or if they do, they aren't noticed to the degree that good ones are.) We likely build a similar ratio of amazing to bland buildings today, we just don't realize it because all the not-so-good buildings built at the same time are still here with us, whereas the not-so-good buildings from the past aren't.

All major religions, well the Abrahamic religions anyway. Teach that sex before marriage is wrong. Hence being 'anti-sex'. Edit: When I said 'anti-sex', I was assuming that OP meant societies attitude towards sex before marriage. I didn't mean that any Abrahamic religion forbids sex.
No. There is no known material that could stretch that far without breaking under it's own weight. Plus, there is that whole pesky thing where the moon orbits around the earth, and both bodies are spinning themselves all the time, so we would get wrapped around each like a dog on a leash pretty quickly. But you could get part way there with a [space elevetor]( URL_0 ) **EDIT:** The goddamn moon goddamn spins. Once every 28 days thereabouts. Yes, the same hemisphere always points towards us, and no, it won't get tangled in our leash, we will get tangled in its. But it does, in fact spin, counterclockwise from the north pole, it goddamn spins. The Earth also spins, so does your middle school science teacher, in the early grave you all have sent them to. **EDIT 2:** I'm glad so many people got a laugh out of this, I certainly didn't see all these upvotes coming. Please stop drawing attention to this post, the Grammar Vigilantes are coming after me for ending my sentence in a preposition (but they don't seem to care that I used the singular 'teacher', and then the plural 'them', or that I misspelled 'elevator'). **EDIT 3:** Thanks for the gold. I may have to post my own ELI5 to find out what it is. I'm hoping I can use it to buy an amphibious yacht and drive around the world.
Concept cars are usually hand-built. They often don't meet all the regulatory requirements for things like safety features and they may not even have engines if they're only going to be displayed at an indoor show. The purpose is to build hype for a future model and/or show off some new technology or styling feature. The final production model, if there is one, will usually include a few elements from the concept.
Assuming that we took careful care to set the rate such that overall government revenues would not change. In addition we'd have to look at deductions and credits, but let's say we eliminated them as well. Let's assume that all of those problems are addressed and you find a perfect percentage to charge everyone and keep all government revenues exactly the same. What you are asking about here is called a "flat tax". This is where everyone pays literally the exact same percentage of their income in taxes. While this seems very fair, once you take a close look it's VERY not fair. The reason it's considered unfair is because poor people tend to spend much higher percentages of their income on a class of expenses known as necessities of life. We're talking things like food, water, clothing and shelter. Things that are required to keep you alive. Let's take a poor (but not too poor) person. They make $700 per month and pay $500 per month in housing, the rest on food. The housing that they can get for $500 is the cheapest available in their city. OK, but mostly shit and includes roommates. They eat very little and fairly badly on $50 per week. If you charge this person a 10% tax rate, they need to pay $50 per month in taxes. Thie reduces their food budget by 25%, so now they don't get to eat for the last week of every month. Now lets look at a rich person. They earn $10,000 per month and spend $5,000 per month on housing. They eat well, spending $150 per week and have plenty of money leftover for savings and other luxuries. A 10% tax on this rich person will not impact their food budget. It will mean they put less into savings, or spend less on luxury items, perhaps they might select a cheaper home. But they will not go hungry. Basically what I'm getting at here is that poor people spend a much higher percentage of their income on the necessities of life than wealthy people do. Even in cases where a rich and poor person both spend the same percentage of their income on something like housing (a rare case, but one that can exist), it's still unfair because the rich person is able to spend less on a less nice home whereas the poor person is already in the cheapest home available. This is where the concepts of discretionary spending come into play. A wealthy person has not only more money to spend but more ability to decide where to spend the money that they have. Poor people are restricted because they are already scraping the bottom of the barrel to get anything, so there's not really any room to move downwards. So a flat tax actually is considered regressive (poor people pay more) because we should be looking at discretionary income, not total income. That's the intent of our tax system, to take into account the fact that poorer people don't have as much room to move and save as richer people do. So we say if you make less than X amount you don't need to pay anything as you don't have any discretionary income. As you move up the income chain, more and more of your income is discretionary. therefore we charge you a higher and higher percentage of income. If you make $1,000,000 per month, you likely have a VERY expensive house and some nice cars, but you don't NEED those things to live. At that level, 99% of your income is discretionary.
The Deep Web is simply content not searchable via Search Engines and are hard to find unless you know the direct address. The "Deep Web" you speak of, is a set of such sites only accessible by using [TOR]( URL_0 ) to provide anonymity as much as possible. The Deep Web uses TOR to provide a 'not' DNS for IP to Web address translation via something called a .onion which your browser cannot regularly open. Once on a TOR network, you can access a .onion the same way you would a .com. Once you know of a .onion to visit, though there is a 'deep web' form of google not even a quarter of the sites are indexed on it you can simply visit it and you will be on the "Deep Web".
There are a variety of complaints against Mother Teresa. Here are some of the most common. 1- She accepted donations from shady sources including infamous 3rd world dictators and embezzled funds. She also associated with various questionable figures, and took sides in Indian politics. 2- She used very little of the donations for actual charity. Much of the donations she received went to either missionary work or the general RCC funds, even when earmarked for charity. The exact proportion is unknown because she refused to release any info except where absolutely required by law. 3- The medical care she offered did not meet standards, even for third world hospice care. And quotes like this, "I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people," and "the most beautiful gift for a person that he can participate in the sufferings of Christ," certainly don't put her in the best light. Her goal was never to treat the poor sick. Her goals were conversion and to help people suffer properly to prepare their souls for the afterlife. Added to this the fact that she went to western hospitals when she herself got sick, makes her look like a hypocrite as well. 4- She had patients baptized, apparently without a full and proper Catechism or understanding of what was being done to them. Now your view on whether these are bad are not depends on your point of view on these subjects. Maybe she was a devoted missionary who took a hold of whatever tools she could to perform an important duty. Or maybe she was a sadistic individual who hung out with evil men and tortured her so called patients. But in any case she wasn't the saintly medical caregiver as she was frequently portrayed.
Multiple reasons: The exoskeleton of the ant distributes the force more quickly across its entire body (due to being more stiff than fluffy human tissue), protecting more vulnerable parts. The small size makes it more resistant to blows - this is because volume (and mass) scales faster than surface area (r^3 instead of r^2). So smaller objects have a larger surface area per unit mass, which makes them move more easily even with light forces (like wind). The mass is what causes inertia ("pushing back" against your finger while you apply the force) and the force is distributed over its surface area. So your applied force is distributed across a relatively large (compared to its volume) surface area (leading to a relatively low pressure), while the low mass (very low, due to aforementioned scaling) makes it easy to move. This means you won't be applying your force for more than a fraction of a second before the ant is moving along with your finger, no longer receiving any significant force. Since you're not applying this force over any time (or distance), the total energy transferred into the ant is very small. This, combined with the effective armor exoskeleton, is why it's difficult to kill insects by swatting them into empty space, but if you push them against a solid object, they squash easily. TL;DR: Resistant exoskeletons and general properties of small objects make them less likely to be crushed by an outside force. True ELI5: It's like trying to break a balloon by punching it in midair. The punch is certainly hard enough, but the balloon just kind of gets pushed away. *edit: spelling* *edit2: added true ELI5*
Full disclosure: Nearly just got killed by a semi that failed to notice a speed table while walking back from lunch break; it actually grazed me enough as it passed me by to sort of pirouette me around and into a mailbox. Semi just kept on going, a nearby homeless guy ran over and made sure I was alright, but I couldn't answer him -- I was just too busy laughing and giggling, and I don't know why. I've heard of other people reacting this way to nearly dying though, especially if it's sudden, so I assume there's something going on here.
Because there are laws defining marriage to be a union between one woman and one man. It's somewhat misleading to say that gay marriage is illegal; it just doesn't *exist*, according to the laws of the places which ban it.
I wrote my dissertation on this very topic and I don't think anyone's nailed it in their answers yet. Edit - I've only got a hard copy of the dissertation (I graduated years ago). Thanks to everyone who asked to read it, if I remember I'll try and scan it. Crash91 has got a lot right but has made a few points I disagree with. So, Heavy Metal - This grew out of Hard Rock and used the same scales, rhythms and subject matter. Black Sabbath are widely cited as the first true Heavy Metal band, giving birth to both the Heavy Metal genre in general and the Doom Metal genre in particular. Led Zepellin, Deep Purple etc are Hard Rock and are only accepted as Heavy Metal bands in the US. In the UK Heavy Metal begins with Sabbath. Original Heavy Metal was fairly slow, gloomy, bluesy and lyrically dealt with subjects such as war, drugs, religion and occult themes. Vocals clean and sung. Later iterations in the 70s, such as Saxon, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are also considered Heavy Metal but are sometimes referred to as NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) and were pioneers of the 'chugging' guitar sound people often associate with classic Heavy Metal as well as the use of twin guitar harmonised leads. Generally faster and more bombastic, the vocals of NWOBHM were more high pitched and the lyrics while dealing with similar themes, more fantastical. Hair or Glam Metal also grew out of this style (but it's awful!). Thrash Metal - Thrash was a product of the 80s and metal's reaction to the aggression of Punk in the late 70s. The band that kick started the whole thing were Venom from Newcastle in the UK. They are sometimes classed as NWOBHM but they don't really fit in that category because they were pretty poor musicians. Their contribution was mainly down to aural extremity, though they sound fairly tame now. They had a 'heavier' sound than previous bands combining speed, harsher distortion tone on their guitars, faux satanic lyrics and shouted/growled vocals. They were a big influence on a lot of Thrash and Black metal bands but were pretty rubbish themselves (controversial opinion!). Early Thrash was pretty loose and messy with a lot of poor musicianship, bands like Sodom, Kreator and Destruction (Germany) made an unholy racket and began to attract the punk kids as well as the metalheads. Later bands worked out how to play their instruments better and the drumming in particular became more accomplished. Classic Thrash as played by the big four (Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer and Anthrax) combines very fast drumming often using 'punkier' beats, NWOBHM guitar riffs played at faster speeds, more aggressive vocals and 'face ripping' (extremely fast and shrill) solos which are often atonal (not in any given key!). Lyrically Thrash was concerned with politics, nuclear war and occult/satanic themes. Death Metal - In the late 80s there was a lot of genre cross pollination and this lead to Death Metal and Grindcore (as well as many other specialist 'cores). Death Metal ramps up the intensity, complexity, heaviness and obscenity of Thrash Metal. It downtunes the guitars (makes them sound deeper) and is characterised by a particular drum beat known as the 'blast beat', and the use of double kick pedals on the bass drum to achieve a rumbling, machine-gun like effect. The vocals are extremely low grunts, growls and roars and are almost impossible to decipher without a lyric sheet. Similar to Thrash, early Death Metal bands struggled to make their musicianship meet their intentions but later bands and a lot of modern bands play music of quite dizzying complexity utilising odd time signatures and even bizarre tunings (tuning the strings on their guitars differently) to make the sound more unsettling. This is the overall 'heaviest' style of metal sonically and lyrically deals with all manner of things including but not limited too, gore, zombies, war, sexual perversions, horror movies, torture and ancient Egypt (that's just one band called Nile from the US to be fair). Death Metal's heyday was the late 80s and early 90s but there's still plenty of great modern Death Metal being made today. While Thrash is seen as a retro style that will always evoke the early 80s, Death Metal has evolved much further and incorporated far more styles including, doom, prog, industrial and middle eastern/oriental music. Black Metal - This one's a bit unique as it all began with a small group of teenagers in Jessheim in Norway in the late 80s/early 90s. They wanted to be 'evil' and 'extreme' but they lacked the musical ability to rival the predominantly (at the time) Swedish and American Death Metal scenes. So instead they did what anyone would do (not) they started burning down churches, proclaiming themselves 'Satanists' and killing each other. They were influenced by bans such as Venom (UK), Mercyful Fate (Denmark) and Celtic Frost (Switzerland) all of whom had elements of NWOBHM and Thrash in their sounds but distinguished themselves by being 'Satanic' with varying degrees of seriousness. Whether or not they were serious, the kids in Norway took it all very seriously and out of that scene came what's come to be known as the 'Second Wave of Black metal', generally accepted as it's 'classic' phase. This style is typified by ultra lo-fi production values including lots of hiss, feedback and distortion a focus on treble rather than bass and vocals that were shrieked or screamed rather than grunted or growled. The music itself is far more primitive and basic than Death Metal and often utilises fast tremolo (rapid down/up strokes on a single string) guitar parts and minor scale arpeggios. Guitar solos are rare. Due to these production techniques the music can take on a hypnotic quality where it's passed through heavy on to something more languid on the other side. Critics say it's poorly played, badly recorded and the product of stupid teenagers with offensive views. The early Norwegian black metal guitar sound has often been likened to a swarm of angry wasps in a box but those who love it find something spiritual about it. The lyrics deal with Satanism of course but also a strand of Nietzschean elitism and an affinity with the Norwegian landscape (ice, frost, forests, mountains etc). Later Black Metal has evolved in myriad ways and incorporated allsorts of other styles including folk, celtic, oriental/middle eastern, prog, goth, shoegaze and traditional Nordic music. Offshoots include Blackened Death Metal, Viking Metal and Symphonic Black metal which combines the music with sweeping orchestral backing. Hope this helps, I could go on for days. If you want recommendations, here are mine; Heavy Metal - Paranoid by black Sabbath NWOBHM - British Steel by Judas Priest Thrash Metal - Reign in Blood by Slayer Death Metal - Demigod by Behemoth Melodic Death Metal - Slaughter of the Soul by At The Gates Black Metal - Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk by Emperor Someone asked for a tl;dr so; Heavy Metal - Clean vocals, bluesy riffs, witches, weed and war. Thrash Metal - Speedy guitar riffs, punk attitude, hardcore drumming, shouty vocals, political lyrics. Death Metal - Downtuned guitars, complex riffs, machine gun drums, grunting/growling vocals, lyrics about horror movies, zombies and gore. Black metal - Trebly guitars, simple riffs, atmospheric arrangements, shrieking vocals, Satanism.
a 45 caliber bullet travels ar 800 to 1100 feet per second through generally a 5" length barrel. On the lower end 800x12=9600 inches per second for a 5 inch distance.

A global temperature, in this instance, is the average of the whole globe over the whole year. The rapid temperature change you're asking about is a local temperature shift.
Most of the answers here are plain wrong. Actually, you try to have the load as close the the helicopter as possible (within reasonable limits, of course). There are several problems with dangling it far below: * Vibrations can build up in the wire, even to the point where the hook releases (I've seen that happen). * The load becomes a giant pendulum, which takes skill to keep in check, as it tends to have a will of it's own. All manouvres have to be planned further in advance, and done with more precision. * When the load has been dropped, the long wire is a potential hazard if it's not weighted down properly. You don't want it to snap up into the tail rotor. * Maximum speed is lower, due to above problems. * The pilot has a harder time being really accurate when hooking/unhooking, as the load will be further away. Usually, the load is just hanging a meter or two below the helicopter. You want enough clearance so that the cargo won't hit the helicopter, should the weight shift. There are exceptions, of course: * When the circumstances don't allow a short wire. For example, if there are trees or you are building a power line. * When making a movie. It looks more impressive with a long wire. * When the load is large, so that the downwash will push down on the load. For example, some large antennas or building materials. Source: My father was a helicopter pilot, and I often worked with him. Note: I know they usually don't use a wire, but I don't know the proper English word for the nylon loops used.

"Activated charcoal" is carbon - which, you know, is what charcoal is made out of, mostly. They press it into smaller bits with more surface area. Carbon like that has a lot of porous area where chemical *adsorption* can occur. Adsorption is like absorption, kind of, in that your material is "sucking up" something from a liquid or gas. In the case of adsorption, atoms and molecules stick to the surface area of your material. Charcoal, particularly activated charcoal, has a *lot* of surface area, so it can adsorb a *lot* of stuff and it can do it quickly and efficiently, and also cheaply. ~~That's why they use charcoal to pump your stomach when you have alcohol poisoning. The carbon sucks up all the alcohol, then they remove the saturated carbon from your stomach, bringing the alcohol with it. What carbon remains to go through your digestive tract contains the alcohol so you can't absorb it into your blood.~~ [^^Or ^^not ^^maybe?]( URL_0 ) ^^I ^^dunno, ^^point ^^is ^^it ^^sucks ^^up ^^poisonous ^^stuff ^^in ^^your ^^stomach. It's also used in aquariums to suck up waste in the water so it can be removed when you change your filter. It's especially good at removing heavy metals, which are sometimes present in your water at concentrations that are not high enough to hurt you but high enough to hurt your livestock. Similarly, it's used in water purification systems (like your Brita filter) to similarly suck up some stuff in your tap water that you are trying to filter out. EDIT: And some gas masks, and industrial air pollution scrubbers, and a number of similar filtering applications. It's quite good at actually sucking up toxic chemicals. Just, you know...not out of your face. That tendency to suck up heavy metals has created a mystique about it, that it sucks up "toxins". If it can purify your water, why not purify your skin? It can suck up "toxins" out of your face! (Pro tip: it doesn't.) Edit: when they make you swallow charcoal for a pill overdose or swallowing poison, *it does nothing to the drugs or poison in your blood*. If you still have some left in your stomach, it soaks that up so that your OD or poisoning doesn't get any worse. What's in your blood is still there and has to be dealt with in other ways.
A skimmer is a device that can read the information off your credit card without you noticing. The information can be used to create a clone of your card that can be used to buy items. For example someone could have a skimmer on a payment terminal. You could use the terminal and the skimmer stores your credit card information internally. Later on the criminals can return to retreive their skimmer and read your credit card information. They can then make a replica of your credit card and go to another store and buy something. Your bank will process the payment as it thinks you made the purchase. Nobody will notice until you check your credit card statement and makes the bank aware of this. By that time it can be very hard to track down the criminals.
Entertainment contracts are... complicated. And Charlie and his team know how he could continue to meet the demands of his contract and get paid. The contract probably (read: it absolutely did) have termination payments and such for various reasons and clauses for outs for both sides. For whatever reasons, the producers decided to go the firing route, preventing him from riding out his contract and causing conflict.
Mammals all kind of have the same idea of cuteness. A human values big eyes, playfulness, and soft fur as a sign of infants, which are adorable because nature wants us to give us as much incentive to protect babies as possible. Reptiles and insects have no need for cuteness, nor do they have the usual "cute" traits. That being said there are plenty of people who find those things cute. Geckos, for example, are sometimes and exception.
Think about it this way - what if you were hungry, but no matter how much food you ate, you were *always* hungry - you don't die of starvation, you're physically fine, you just *can never stop your hunger*. That's what depression is like, but the hunger is - [I've had a number of people take umbrage with my usage of "sadness." Even though I suffer from it myself, I find sadness, more than other perhaps more technically accurate terms, helps best explain the sort of *weight* of the illness. But out of fairness, I've expanded the metaphor to more accurately describe the way it manifests at least for me, personally, which hopefully both people who suffer from depression and those who do not can find a deeper truth in] -hopelessness, lethargy, despair: a gravitational black hole in the core of you that swallows up everything you take into it - all the love from people around you, all the achievements and accomplishments and accolades, all the fun and joy and parties and friendships, *everything* - and leaves you will this impossibly dense, cold, dead star inside you, and just as that dead star sucks in everything around you, so too does it pull *you* in, stronger and stronger, and every single day is a battle just to stay UP, to resist being dragged down into the blackness that is self-annihilation, self-obliteration, until eventually you find yourself wondering *why* you're resisting, why you're bothering, because the only thing you're fighting for is day after day of that cold nothingness with no visible respite. You can't even *see* over the event horizon; its gravity is so powerful it bends the light at the end of the tunnel, convinces you that your future is oblivion, obscures your ability to envision any future where this endlessly hungry dead thing is *not* the core of you. And it hurts - it hurts *physically*, because without hope, without a positive vision of the future, your brain will slowly stop pumping out dopamine and endorphins, all the hormones that wash away life's little aches and pains and bothers, because your brain has *no justification* to try and make life better; the dead star in you has eaten your aspirations, your dreams and ambitions, and your brain shrugs and gives up dispensing with the typical pharmaceuticals that get us up and out and running and jumping all around; you're tired, and you're in pain, and everything you eat, everything you do is like sawdust in your mouth, bland and purposeless, and at that point it doesn't matter who you are - a fifteen year old kid, a married mother of three, or even Robin Fucking Williams, who had more money and fame and talent and success and global admiration than almost anyone else on the planet - literally none of it matters, because there's no amount of *matter* that will ever satiate a black hole; and at that point it becomes a true testament to the strength of the human condition, when you look at depression not a question of *why do people who are depressed become suicidal*, but rather, *how do so many people with depression hold out their fight for so god damn long in the face of such and overwhelming antagonist*? Depression is, at its core, a recurring pattern of negativity. Think of it like a loop. You brain is constantly reinforcing negativity. It doesn't matter if the events of the day are good or bad; your mind, separate of your conscious will, sends negative thoughts; self-loathing thoughts, hopeless thoughts, etc. This becomes a feedback loop that reinforces helplessness - you know spending time with loved ones is *supposed* to make you happy, but instead you feel nothing, or it makes you feel tired, or terrible. The fact that these positive things did not make you *feel* positive, in turn, makes you feel worse. Imagine, to return to the food metaphor, if eating not only did not satiate you, but made you *hungrier*. You would begin to associate food - normally the thing used to alleviate hunger - with the hunger itself, and begin to avoid it, and would likely feel helpless and frustrated that the *normal* course of action to dealing with hunger, eating, only made you feel worse. This frustration and helplessness would lead to more negativity, and so on. When we think of something being "hard", in life, be it sickness or other challenges, we use our *minds* to overcome it. We persevere, we find hope, we find happiness. This is the human condition. This is why depression is so insidious. It takes away the very thing that people usually use to find strength. Your happiness, your loves, your *reasons* - depression robs you of these things. It strips you of your ability to find joy and beauty in them. Depression makes everything, every moment of every day, a challenge, with no real respite. Just a constant feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and purposelessness. There are many theorized reasons for depression - hormonal imbalances, neurotransmitter defects, diet. But regardless of the root cause, it almost always manifests itself as a feedback loop of bad thoughts. Your brain gets "stuck" in a loop of thinking, where no matter what conscious thoughts you generate, you always get sucked back down into a cycle of negativity, sadness, and depression. This is one reason that psychologists are starting to seriously look at hallucinogenics as a possible treatment for depression: because they have a sort of dissociative effect; they can "break" this loop and elevate thought above or outside of it. It is almost impossible to see outside of the loop while you're *in* it, but gaining the perspective offered by something like LSD can have a profound effect in "teaching" the brain how it can escape cyclical thought patterns in favor of more beneficial thought patterns.
The "livestock" living on your towels/clothing need a warm, wet and semi dark to dark environment. Placing them in the sun removes the water. Water is very necessary for life. Imagine if you got lost in the middle of a desert. No water, too much sun, little to no food. Your ability to survive would be dependent on finding shade and water. So basically putting clothing or towels in the sun causes desertification of their little ecosystem.
Genetically, our collective evolution led to some significant constants. I guarantee you that a set of guys with super-long fingers or giant legs would find it much harder to survive in an early-civilization society, for a variety of scientific reasons that are beyond the scope of this question. However, something that didn't directly impact survival wouldn't be weeded out or overwhelmingly propagated throughout humanity, because it doesn't matter. Guy A has a 4-incher, guy B has a 6-incher... so? They aren't using that thing to find a mate. Since women have held less power historically, they couldn't really *choose* what guy they wanted per se - and even if they could, we have no idea whether penis size was something they were really interested in. So unless your penis was basically unusable (either too small or too big to insert semen into a woman) your penis genes survived just like everyone else's. Same for things like skin tone and detailed facial structure - unless society really cares about that stuff, your genes will survive. It's not going to ruin your genetic propagation. BTW, just as a disclaimer: size is not 100% genetic.
Do you judge the chef or the farmer for how your meal turned out? Sometimes it's the ingredients that make or break a dish but it's the chef's job to take what they got and transform it into something tasty.
Seems pretty clear to me that GTA is satire, for which it is essential to NOT have real brands. The point is to make caricatures, parodies and general exaggerations of real life brands/makes/models/companies/people/pop culture. They would be censored on 99% of the things they said if they used real names, which they would never intend to do anyway.
When you're reading the constitution, if it says citizen, then you have to be a citizen to have that right. If it says person, then any human within the jurisdiction of the US has that right whether here legally or not. So, like the 5th and 14th amendments specify person, so they apply.
Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution specifically allows Congress to compel the attendance of absent members, and to determine the rules for proceedings, which presumably include in-person attendance. As for why they don't expand "attendance" to mean teleconferencing, it's probably because of tradition, and because it would look bad for a member of Congress to be able to vote while absent.
True Celiacs make-up a very very small portion of the population. Were talking like 0.5-1% of the population. They wouldn't have even registered on the radar. Plus a true Celiac living back then would have probably died of something else way more prevalent and life threatening (e.g. nutritional deficiencies, infection) before their condition killed them.
First realize Switzerland had no specific resources needed by anyone. They are resource poor. They also have a history of having a strong self defense ability. Every man was a trained soldier with a rifle stored in his home. Those mountains are honeycombed with tunnels and defensive firing positions. They had no great strategic value and were literally to tough to be worth a symbolic conquest.
The Reagan Adiministration wanted the CIA to back the Contras in Nicaragua, but due to laws passed by the congress, they were unable to. Congress didn't want to fund the CIA, but the CIA was sought funding elsewhere. So, the story goes that they had someone smuggle cocaine into the United States to be sold, and they would take their cut of the profit to in turn fund the Contras. Here are some wikipedia links about the event and some of the main players:  URL_3   URL_2   URL_4   URL_1   URL_0  Also, the book "Dark Alliance" by the late Gary Webb is a collection of articles that Webb wrote and were published in the San Jose Mercury News. Edit: Changed context and added link. Edit II: I seem to have struck gold. A special thanks to my anonymous benefactor.
The city was built and supported by the growing auto industry. In the 70's and 80's a lot of external factors (rising prices, competition, new labor laws etc) forced most of the car companies to change their business models/move somewhere else. This means a lot of the manufacturing plants in Detroit were shut down and all of a sudden you had a large percentage of the population unemployed with nowhere to go. The cities economy started to suffer and has never fully recovered back to the state it was in in it's glory days. There's a lot more to it than that, people have written entire books on the decline of Detroit. There's a lot of socioeconomic analysis that can be put into it, but that's the basics.
The feeling of love is something that is pleasing to the mind psychologically (obviously). It is one of the most potent stimulator for the release of certain chemicals stored in the body into the bloodstream. The body releases a cocktail of chemicals into your blood every time the mind is filled with love that act directly on your heart to make it beat faster, among other things. The heaviness you feel is literally your heart squeezing more blood and beating faster. Not the most comprehensive explanation, but hope this helps.
Those stones (called track ballast) serve four primary purposes: - Load-bearing (it distributes and bears the weight of the railroad ties) - Facilitation of water drainage away from the ties - Keeps out vegetation that could interfere with the structure of the track - Helps keep the ties in place
Assange went to Ecuadorian territory (an embassy is their territory, ~~technically~~ basically), so he followed their rules on granting Diplomatic Asylum. For Snowden he's probably be granted the same if he went to Ecuador's embassy, but he'd have to go into Moscow for that, which wouldn't happen. Regarding "what is the **real** reason" the best we can tell you is what those countries say, everything else is just useless speculation.
I believe once upon a time Times New Roman font size 12 was the default size and then to signify the changing of times from the printed to electronic age Microsoft changed it to what it is now.  URL_0 
I'm sure there will be a far more technical answer written soon, but I'll just say: have you SEEN them, man? They're brilliant!
In the 80s the Bronx, NY basically created rap. However by the early 90s South Central LA dominated the music scene with a new sound called gangsta rap. In response to frustration over not getting airplay, someone wrote a song called "Fuck Compton" and just dissed everyone at NWA. Eventually it fell to the two biggest artists, BIG and 2pac, to be the champions of each side. Because some people don't understand a marketing gimmick when they see one, both men were killed by people who took the rivalry way too seriously. After that, it stopped being fun.
Atmosphere, which is a collection of gasses (including water vapor), has physical properties (temperature, pressure, etc) that let it hold a certain amount of moisture. Anything past that limit, and you can't add more moisture to the air. It's holding as much moisture as possible. So 100% doesn't mean you're walking around underwater, it just means the air is fully saturated with moisture.
They don't, no. They slowly forget the world around them, to the point where it's not like a vague memory, or they know something happened but they don't know exactly, it's like it never happened at all. To look at it another way - reincarnation is real. Can you remember anything about your previous life? Would you recognise the faces if you met them in this life?
There is indeed a substantial co-occurrence of major depression and various anxiety disorders; while it's inevitably difficult to get accurate numbers, some estimates put it above 50%, with GAD and panic disorder leading. In one of the largest antidepressant trials which didn't try to select for "pure" depression, anxious depression was the norm. Why is a much more difficult question, because the root causes of major depression and anxiety disorders are fundamentally not known. Every serious source in the psychiatric literature stresses what we don't know; while there's always someone out there who will give you a clean and intuitive answer about magic brain chemicals, they really shouldn't. Besides, these are clinical diagnoses, which makes it hard to know whether what we're seeing on the surface correlates with one or more underlying issues; imagine trying to figure out the cause of pneumonia without microscopes or the concept of germs. That said, as I once heard it explained, "we now know a lot more about what we don't know." One simple explanation is that they share many risk factors, both genetic and environmental. Another line of research concerns the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is tremendously important in the stress response, and implicated to some extent in most psychiatric problems.

These are in ear monitors. If they do not have them they usually have speakers on stage directed at them. The problem with performing a music piece is that you do not hear how the music sounds when you are in the middle of it. The normal speakers are pointed towards the public and sound moves quite slow though the air. So you might perform a guitar solo on one side of the stage and hit every beat as you hear the bass guitar on the other side of the stage and it sounds perfect to you. However to the public it sounds like you are too slow and quiet because the sounds takes some time to go from the bass guitar across the stage to you. So to make sure you hear the beat and the music as the public hear it you need to monitor the sound coming though the sound system. Before sound systems small bands used to stand much closer together on the stage and look at each other rather then out to the public. Bigger orchestra would have a director in front or even among the public who could direct them using movement.
Insects don't have the complex brain structure to form concepts. But what can happen is that when some insects die, they release a pheromone that is detected by the rest of their comrade, and they'll come to defend against whatever killed one of their own. Individually they are stupid but as a colony insects are very clever. TL;DR he's a lazy bitch tell him to clean it up
Imagine you are are a preindustrial farmer. You get up before dawn, toil in the field all day, then go back home when it gets dark. For breakfast, you want something hot that will give you a lot of energy, but can be prepared quickly. For lunch, you want a cold meal you can take with you and eat when you get hungry. For dinner, you have time between sunset and bedtime, so you can take a little longer, and have something nice while socializing with friends and family. The pattern of necessity has become ingrained in our culture, so we consider certain foods to be appropriate for certain meal, long after the original reasons were forgotten.
SGK died in the 80s. The charity that has her name is run and was founded by, her younger sister Nancy Brinker. Nancy drew a salary of $684,000 last year. I'll leave that up to you to decide if it's fair or not. The main issue that people have with the SGK foundation is that they don't actually seem to be after a cure for cancer. For example, if I make a cancer fun run and decide to call it a "run for the cure". The SGK foundation is going to sue me for using their trademark. From Wikipedia  >  Komen has come under fire for legal action against other non-profits or organizations using the phrase "for the cure" within their names. An August 2010 article in The Wall Street Journal detailed a case in which the organization Uniting Against Lung Cancer was told in a letter from Komen that they should no longer use the name "Kites for the Cure" for their annual fund-raising event. Komen also wrote to the organization to warn them "against any use of pink in conjunction with 'cure.'"[80] More than 100 small charities have received legal opposition from Komen regarding various uses of the words "for the cure" in their names.[81] Among the offending charitable organizations and events were "Par for the Cure", "Surfing for a Cure", "Cupcakes for a Cure" and "Mush for the Cure".

To understand this properly, we need to break down what exactly we're talking about. The "big bang" is the name given to our theory about how the universe evolved in its early development. The name is very misleading - it was not really a big explosion like a bomb or a supernova. The early universe was extremely hot and incredibly energy-dense. As you may be aware, hot things give off radiation in the form of photons. The early universe was pretty much uniformly filled with a very hot plasma that emitted and absorbed radiation. But this emitted radiation could not travel very far before being absorbed - the universe was still an opaque "fog". During this early period, space expanded very rapidly (which is what most people confuse for the "explosion"). This expansion happened *everywhere*, causing the universe to cool down. Eventually (and I'm summarizing here), the universe cooled down enough that atoms could form. Soon, there were many more atoms than just raw protons and electrons. These atoms could not absorb the radiation the way charged particles could, so the universe became *transparent*. The photons could travel much longer distances without encountering something that could absorb them. Remember how this expansion of space was happening everywhere? That means that these ancient photons are still around, hurtling through the universe. The only difference is, they don't look like photons to us any more. Over the ages, their wavelengths have expanded along with the expansion of space. In fact, in the late 1940s, scientists predicted that we should still be receiving this radiation. The only difference is, it would appear to us as microwave radiation, which has longer wavelengths than visible light. In the 1960s, two scientists at Bell Labs stumbled upon this radiation by accident. They were testing a very sensitive antenna and they noticed that it would pick up a constant "background" signal. Eventually, they realized they had stumbled upon this relic of the early universe. Today, we call this the "Cosmic Microwave Background" and it provides some very valuable insights into the early universe.
They owe money to other countries, civilians, companies, retirement funds and investment institutions that buy treasury bonds or government debt. Every country is in debt because it makes financial and economic sense. The interest rate charged to countries on loans are typically low and thus in almost all cases the benefit their able to gain from investing/spending that loaned money is greater than the downside of having to make interest payments.
Nurse here. Imagine your bladder being a balloon. The balloon gets filled (with urine) and when it's about half way full, stretch receptors in the wall of the balloon starts sending signals to your brain that you need to pee. When you pee the balloon empties itself, and kinda deflates, meaning the stretch receptors are no longer sending signals to the brain about you needing to pee. Bonus info: the body produces on average 1ml/kg body weight urine per hour meaning if you weigh 80 kg you produce about 80 ml of urine per hour. You start to feel the urge to pee when the bladder contains 300-400ml of urine. Bonus info 2: don't keep your bladder full too often, because the stretch receptors in the bladder tissue might get stretched too much, and get damaged, which can lead to incontinence.
They're ads that the companies with the downloads are paying for. Many sites with the fake download buttons are either illegal or not the main route of downloading things so they see less traffic and have to find alternate methods of financial gain.
Doing a lot of small task is usually easier than doing one big task. For example nobody has any problem reading reddit all day, but reading a full book is hard and daunting. Every time you finish doing something, you get some kind of satisfaction, and we like to get that often.
The age of consent varies widely across state lines, however there is still a charge referred to as "corrupting a minor". This makes it a crime to provide certain things to those under the age of majority. As such, you cannot provide pornography to a minor, in the same way that a minor can't be in a pornographic film. That said, the Internet has made it pretty easy to obtain.
A lot of the answers in this thread are trying to explain or rationalize *specific* fetishes, but I think OP's question is more general in nature. First, a point of clarification: the word "fetish" in common language essentially means "a sexual attraction or fixation on body parts, objects, or activities not normally associated with sex." It's essentially when a person can be particularly sexually aroused by something that isn't typically considered to be arousing. Psychologists have not yet agreed upon a single explanation for why people form fetishes in the first place, but a common explanation involves (accidental) positive feedback loop of classical conditioning on the part of the fetishist. Under the right conditions, somebody who might *weakly* associate a non-sexual stimulus with sex will be able to get arousal out of it, which only further strengthens the association and the arousal that can be gained. Let's say that you're a straight guy with pretty vanilla sexual tastes. You're browsing porn on the internet, when all of a sudden you come across a video featuring a girl wearing a cat ear headband. At this point, you don't have a particular fixation with this sort of thing, but it doesn't turn you off either, and the girl is cute, so you like the video anyway. Meanwhile, your brain is picking up on the cat ears as something "new," and novelty is a *big* factor in your brain's reward system, so when you finish, you've formed a slight association between "girl wearing cat ears" and "getting your rocks off." Fast forward in time a bit to another porn session, and you come across *another* video with a girl wearing cat ears. The reward center in your brain remembers the last one, and is going "yeah, this was good last time, I like this one too." The situation repeats, and strengthens the association between catgirls and sexual pleasure. Repeat this process enough times, and you'll get to the point where you *actively seek* porn with catgirls in it, and maybe you even *require* it to get it up. There won't be a rational reason for you to like this sort of thing, you just *do*, because you've inadvertently trained yourself to like it. EDIT: Alright, a lot of you are asking the same questions, and I don't have the time to respond to all of you, so I'm just going to put this shit up top. * The core thing to keep in mind is that this is all about *arousal*, which is distinct from *pleasure*. Yes, they often go hand-in-hand, but "arousal" is basically another word for "excitement," and has meanings that go beyond *sexual* arousal. Anything that excites you, that gets your blood pumping, that gives you a tiny rush of adrenaline and endorphins, can be be considered "arousing." Yes, a lap dance can do that, but so can being threatened with a knife, or being tied down, or being humiliated, or whatever. The associations we make with arousing stimuli depend enormously on the context and timing that we experience them with. If a nonsexual-but-still-arousing stimulus is presented with a sexual stimulus or context, then sexual association can begin to form around that nonsexual cue. * It's *entirely* possible that fetishes might have their origins before somebody reaches puberty. Like I said, "arousal" is just "excitement," and is hard-wired into us even more deeply than sex. Understanding of sex and sexual maturity are not requirements for people to be influenced by outside sources. The example I cited with porn is just an *example*, and there's no reason why the same mechanism can't happen earlier in life, and completely by accident. Just because you recognized something as a childhood fetish in retrospect doesn't mean that it didn't form similarly to how I described. I'm betting that, whether you realized it was sexual or not, you sought out *more* of that thing because it made you feel good, and fell into the same cycle of reinforcement that I've described. Mind you, I'm not judging here, just explaining. * Homosexuality is *not* considered to be a fetish by the mainstream psychological community, so stop citing it as examples of an "innate fetish" or whatnot. It doesn't disprove anything, because you're comparing apples and oranges. However, if you want to talk about *transgenderism*, the field is much less settled on this matter, despite what people on tumblr might say. I'd recommend reading [The Man Who Would be Queen]( URL_0 ), which is a book that ignores all of the politically-correct bullshit around identity politics and actually examines it as a scientific phenomenon without trying to judge the fuck out of everybody involved. I had the good fortune to take a course taught by the author, and I swear to god I have never met a person who was as committed to taking an *objective* look at human sexuality as he is.
Well, a lot of the security measures are just theatre. The truth is, someone who is truly determined to do harm on board an airplane will be able to do so unless they don't allow you to bring anything (I can think of loads of ways...like stabbing someone with a metal knitting needle, which is allowed...seriously). But in order to convince the public that it is safe and that the government will prevent future incidents they choose to ban things that may be severe inconveniences, but that won't stop people from flying. People can always buy new toothpaste or a bottle of overpriced water inside the airport. They cannot, however, replace all their electronics or travel without them in many cases (for example, a business traveller).
Taxes, lots and lots of taxes. Its called sin tax, my girlfriend did her masters paper on it.  URL_0  from the wiki page on canada taxation: Both the federal and provincial governments impose excise taxes on inelastic goods such as cigarettes, gasoline, alcohol, and for vehicle air conditioners. A great bulk of the retail price of cigarettes and alcohol are excise taxes. The vehicle air conditioner tax is currently set at $100 per air conditioning unit. Canada has some of the highest rates of taxes on cigarettes and alcohol in the world. These are sometimes referred to as sin taxes. It is generally accepted that higher prices deter consumption of these items which have been deemed to increase health care costs stemming from those who use them.
I actually discussed this with my fiancée the other day. Realistically we would only send women and carry stored semen for the men. This is because in order to grow the numbers as quickly as possible we would want as many wombs at the start as possible, and men would be too much of a life support and weight burden for the population benefit. Also in the event that some of the crew is lost it would be a terrible thing if by happenstance all the women were killed. Considering we currently lack the ability to develop a child in an artificial womb that would mean the failure of the mission, so to maximize the allowable loss of crew every crew member should have a womb. Considering varied semen is much more compact than taking male colonists it shouldn't be any trouble at all to send excess genetic diversity for any proposed colony. Of course this implies that every colony would by its nature develop a matriarchal society as the founding members who are the most educated and skilled would all be women, and the first few generations would likely be purely women as well. By the time men are even allowed to come to term there would be far more women than men.
If you're referring to the new Macbook, that port is a USB type-C port, it's an international standard, and you're going to start seeing that port on pretty much everything. Google has already announced that the new Chromebook Pixel is using it. The port is reversible (which is always nice), is faster, and lets you draw more power (useful for charging) than other ports.
Temperature and bugs It's warmer up higher off of the floor, less dusty and bugs and snakes have a harder time getting up there.
Sometimes they didn't. However for the most part it involved big flags and designs on the shields. Some armies were equipped totally different but others where similarly equipped there were special people called heralds who could tell whose design on a flag or shield were who and which side they were supposed to be on.
As mentioned by another poster, they're not subgroups of Catholicism in the sense of denominations if that is what you were thinking. Rather, there are different types of religious "orders". As the previous poster also mentioned, each order has a different way of serving and worshipping God. It's not to say that they believe any particular way is "more correct" than another way, but that it is simply the way they feel is best for *themselves* to glorify God. Some find that through prayer, others through education, others through prayer and reflection. Now, the origin of each of these orders comes from various groups of monastic priests (monks/brothers), and the rituals they would follow under their leader (an abbot).  & nbsp; Whoever founded the order would have several monastic priests under him, and would often form several monasteries in his lifetime. It's not always founded under one specific leader, but to keep the explanation simple we'll treat it that way. Especially when the founder of an order passed away, others would often form new monasteries teaching in the same principles. This is why they are often named after a specific individual. There exist two main "divisions" when it comes to these orders: active and contemplative.  & nbsp; Active would be those such as the Franciscans (St. Francis of Assisi), the Jesuits (St. Francis Xavier, after whom Pope Francis took his Papal name), and the Dominicans (St. Dominic). These "active" orders are the ones often going out and preaching, serving the poor, etc. Unless you visit a monastery, these are the ones you would be more likely to run into somewhere. The "contemplative" are more of the typical image of what a monk/brother is, living in the monastery with other monks, spending most of the day in prayer, reading Scripture, etc. As their name would imply, these are the ones spending most of their time in solitude, dedicating their lives to God in this manner.  & nbsp; If you would like an overview of the most-popular orders, [this webpage]( URL_0 ) does a good job of explaining what each one specifically dedicates themselves too.

The issue with vaping is that it is a relatively new way to use nicotine. It took decades of research and observation to identify the adverse health effects to chronic users of other tobacco products, and it will likely take a similar amount of time to confidently identify any problems that arise with e-cigarette use. That said, e-cigarettes do not contain the same harmful ingredients as cigarettes, which probably makes them safer, although I can't say how much. There have been some studies that show using e-cigarettes increases your risk of developing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or increased phlegm production. It is possible that it could increase your risk for heart disease, although that risk seems to be hypothetical at the moment. As far as cancer goes, while many of the carcinogens found in cigarettes are much lower in e-cigarettes, propylene glycol and glycerol (the main components in the liquid cartridge) both break down into several potential carcinogens. I can't say whether this makes lung cancer/disease more or less likely, however. And of course, nicotine abuse is bad for your cardiovascular system. That has not changed. TLDR; it's up in the air. The general consensus seems to be it is likely safer than cigarettes, however it's possible that there could be some bad stuff in the vapor. If there are negative health consequences, we won't really find out until people start getting sick, unfortunately.
The cards allow them to track what you specifically are buying. It also allows them to more easily do direct marketing to you. That all together will be very valuable to the store... and others they may sell that data too. In addition, it may give you additional incentive to come into their store and shop to get their member deals and buy other stuff as well. There is fierce competition for your dollar, and getting you in their store is the only way they are getting any of it. And if you're going to their store, you may not be going to others. You and your money very valuable. Edit: To add on to this, some store associates are required or get bonuses to get you to sign up for their store cards, although usually this is more in the realm of clothing and home furnishing stores -- not grocery stores etc.
From [Previous thread]( URL_0 ) - Here is a great ELI5 explanation.  >  Have you ever seen pizza made from scratch? The dough begins as a ball. It is then thrown in the air and spun. As it spins, the dough flattens and moves outwards into a disc shape. Solar systems and galaxies form like that.  >  Because they spin. When you have loosely connected matter, like the dust from which galaxies are formed--or, say, pizza dough--as it rotates, it tends to push material away from the axis of rotation. Thus, gravity can compress the matter into a disc-like shape, but the faster it rotates, the harder it is for it to compress into a spherical shape.  >  This applies to the formation of many objects in astrophysics--it's why solar systems tend to have a 'plane' much like galaxies, and even stars are originally formed from a collapsing disk.  >  It's also worth noting that there are more spherical galaxies, as well as a large central bulge in otherwise 'flat' galaxies. There's quite a lot of variance.
I'm going to explain this like I explained it to my actual five-year-old: Germany came late to the industrial revolution. They were able to build on the technological advances of the earlier factories and machines in other countries. Secondly Industries were set up as cartels. So the steel industry was a cartel for example. This led to uniform standards of production and quality. So eventually people noticed that products and materials from Germany were usually "premium" when compared to the average in the market. Tl;dr: they got the best factory equipment, and set up their industry in a very logical way. Cooperation rather than competition
People get bored of looking at pornography and funny cat images eventually.
Previous answer from /u/toasterkid "What you are hearing is the tensor tympani muscle. This is a small muscle in your ear that acts as a dampener of external sound. It attaches to a small bone in the ear and prevents it from oscillating, particularly when chewing. This is why you can also hear it if you move your jaw in certain positions, it also tends to contract when you close your eyes tightly and quickly. You'll notice the sound will only last briefly. This is because the initial contraction of the muscle causes the bone to move creating a rumbling sound. Interestingly, some people have the ability to contract this muscle voluntarily." Also, check out /r/earrumblersassemble :D
In the US, there's already a [mandatory background check]( URL_1 ) to buy a gun in a retail setting (if you buy a new or used gun from a store, you will have a background check). Further, because the federal government can regulate sales of things that cross state lines, it's illegal for two people to sell a gun privately without involving a retail store (and thus a background check) if they don't reside in the same state. There isn't a background check on private sales within most states. So when someone says, we want mandatory background checks on all gun sales, they mean they want them on private, in state gun sales. The opposition points out that we enforce the background checks on retail sales by [very strictly controlling the inventory of retailers]( URL_0 ) (they must keep a log book of every single gun that goes through their store). Gun owners are exceedingly concerned that a similar registration of the guns they own gives the state a tool that's much too useful should it ever wish to seize the guns (since it would know where every single gun in the nation is). This is why there's opposition, the current background checks cover almost all gun sales, and there's too little trust that the means of enforcing private background checks would eventually be the means to facilitate a seizure of private guns.
It's not always just fat "under the skin". A lot of fat is interstitial or spread throughout muscles and in between organs. Think of a nice fatty marbled kobe/wagyu ribeye steak. The fat is all interleaved between muscle fibers. Now there is a lot of subcutaneous fat, but removing it also damages all the connective tissues between the skin and your body, its not as simple as "vacuuming out the fat". Google for a cross section/MRI of an obese body and it'll show you where the fat deposits are spread around. Edit: here's a link to an photo that shows the difference between where the fat is located on an obese vs regular profile. It's also visceral (inside your body cavity) fat that isn't something you can vacuum out either.  URL_0  edit2: there are quite a few people who are disturbingly interested in "dat thigh gap" on the slimmer cross section.. edit3: and for a very medically compelling answer to people asking "Well why can't you just remove the stuff under the skin that you can get to easily", taken from a comment below by /u/huphelmeyer:  > "When more than 5,000 cc's of fatty aspirate are removed, the complication rate rises dramatically. Under these circumstances, massive fluid shifts can occur, which increase the potential for cardiac and pulmonary complications." edit4: there are some very good more detailed answers in some of the other comments. my comment here is mostly focused around helping people realize that body fat is more complicated than just being "under your skin" and there's no easy way to *safely* remove it via surgery.
As is so typical in math, [counting can indeed be generalized.]( URL_0 ) Roughly, counting means establishing a clear one-to-one relationship between the members of one set and the members of another set. Since sets are an extremely elaborate and well-developed topic in abstract math, there is a lot of meat here.
When it comes to a lot of art, context is more important than the actual material. Rarity, historical context etc. make a thing more valuable than its actual aesthetic properties. For example, some shitty buggy SNES or N64 games will sell for huge amounts if they are well preserved and in the original packaging etc, even when any high school student nowadays could write a better game in a week.
Anorexia causes hair loss. They are trying to hide that symptom.
Just the eye being out of the socket won't stop you seeing, assuming the optic nerve is attached and the eye is relatively undamaged from whatever removed it. The field of view won't really be that much expanded by being outside the socket, but the lack of muscles and support may allow the eye to deform enough that focus could be thrown off. Stretching the optic nerve is also likely to result in visual disturbance (and emotional).
It's because the demand is still much, much higher than the supply. Part of this is because real estate in American cities is a pretty good place to store a lot of wealth if you live overseas. It can't be confiscated easily by whatever your local government is, and you can be pretty sure the value will stay high. Add those types to the massive number of people who want to live in big cities and will find a way to make it pay, and there's enough demand to keep costs high.
Same reason you can't tickle yourself, if your brain expects stimuli then the sensation is dulled.
Actually we all start out as a lump of cells when we were still an embryo. When cells divide, you will grow in size and your cells will start to specialize in certain functions (for example skin cells can absorb sunlight). Thus by absorbing enough nutrients, the lump of cells can divide and grow into a human. Now if you want to grow meat, the process is more complex. Main problem is that the cells will try to specialize into a task. So you add drugs to stop the process. Also your Petri dish will run out of nutrients as the cells kept dividing non-stop, thus it will be better if you use an entire tank of cell culture instead. Just keep refilling the tank until the meat is ready. Keep in mind though this is VERY expensive. Controlling the enviroment (temperature, pressure......) is not easy and it cost at least $10000 for a pound of lab grown meat. Most meat we eat today are just animals kept in farms (most likely GM for more meat), which is cheaper and safer.
Stories of cops being called on open carriers are common. That's why the vast majority of people who carry, do so concealed. However, it's pretty easy to tell the difference between an open carrier and an active shooter: Open carriers must have their guns holstered or otherwise out of hand, by law. Walking around with a gun in your hand is an illegal act of brandishing under every state law I've ever seen. Among the few people who habitually open carry, many also make a point of dressing nicely, because they find it greatly decreases the chances that people call the cops.
Here's the really tough part, depending on your hair type, different products do different things. For me: Mousse: make your hair big Gel: sticks your hair in place (think *There's Something About Mary*) Hairspray: sticks your hair in place, but doesn't make it look like cement, like gel can do (and thus, doesn't hold as well) Pommade: gives your hair "texture," makes it less smooth and holds it in place a little more  URL_0  (in a pinch you can substitute Vaseline and it works the same) Wax: depending on the brand, the same as pommade, or thicker for heavier hair Leave-in conditioner: detangles, sometimes adds volume Serum: usually calms frizz, can also add shine Oil: usually used to combat dry scalp, less often to add shine Peanut butter: removes gum from hair Mayonnaise: adds shine, useful way to use up that impulse purchase from Costco
Soccer is popular because you don't need special equipment or infrastructure to play it. You need a spherical object, and a relatively flat field. All other sports need a lot of special equipment or infrastructure.
bias. when people have roomates, they do things and people post shit about it. When people dont have roomates, nothing about roomates is said. No one says 'i live alone and this happened'. so you notice the occasional roomate post and move on to the next ten thousand posts and then after a while you wonder why so many people have roomates. of course there are other reasons. many people have roomates. but i think the one i said before is probably the biggest factor here on reddit
Let's use a 1-pound chocolate bar. Multiplication: if you have a 4 count of 1-pound chocolate bars, you have 4 pounds of chocolate. If you have no 1-pound chocolate bars, you have 0 pounds of chocolate. Makes perfect sense. Division: If you cut the chocolate bar into 4 equal parts, each part is 4 ounces (1/4 of a pound). But try cutting a chocolate bar into zero equal parts... conceptually that makes no sense. If you say that this means removing or destroying the chocolate bar, that would actually be subtraction. In effect, you want to collapse the chocolate bar into fewer than one piece but still expect all 16 ounces of chocolate to still be present in this space where there is no chocolate bar.
The MKUltra project wasn't about some kind of mysterious "mind control" ability. It was a research project to investigate a wide variety of drugs and forms of torture that could be used to further the CIA's agendas. The reason it's often called the "CIA mind control project" is because part of the project was investigating drugs such as LSD that they hoped would make victims vulnerable to suggesting and manipulation. Experiments of the project mostly include administering various drugs to people and then conducting behavioral tests, sometimes without the victims' knowledge or consent. LSD was their primary focus, but they also tested a number of other drugs ([from the Wikipedia article]( URL_0 )):  > Other experiments involved heroin, morphine, temazepam (used under code name MKSEARCH), mescaline, psilocybin, scopolamine, cannabis, alcohol, and sodium pentothal
Hooo mouth shape makes the air go faster which pulls other air along with it. So the warm air from your mouth is closer to normal temperature air because it's mixed more. The faster moving air feels cooler because it can absorb a little heat from whatever you're blowing on and move away to let other air do the same. Haaaa mouth shape doesn't pull other air along with it as much so ends up being closer to the temperature inside your body (warmer) which is normally warmer (and more humid) than what you're blowing on so it feels warmer.
**Short answer**: the difference is in how much your processor does in those clock cycles. **Long answer:** The amount of instructions your processor handles each second depends on two factors: * Clock speed: the speed at which the processor components switch state * Instructions per Clock cycle (IPC): the amount of instructions the processor can handle during one cycle. Clock speed has not improved that much over the last 5-10 years. A higher clock speed results in more heat, and we have hit a limit to how much we can comfortably cool. For desktops that's in between 3-4 GHz, for laptops that's even lower. Therefore lots of improvements have been made to the IPC. Mostly it comes down to parallellism: processing multiple instructions at the same time. If we compare processing instructions to doing the laundry: * Pipelining: instead of washing, drying, ironing the first load, then doing the same for the second, third, ... the second load can already start using the washing machine as soon as the first load is transfered to the dryer. * Instruction parallellism: if two loads of laundry require the same washing machine settings, we can put them together and execute in the same cycle. * Multiple processor cores: we use multiple washing machines, dryers, irons to wach multiple loads at the same time. * Multiple instruction threads per core: if a certain load does not need to be ironed, we can use the iron for another load. EDIT: * Most people seem to use the term "IPC" only to indicate single core performance, here I used it in the broader sense and do count multicore processors as an improvement in IPC. * Cache is indeed a factor I forgot. In laundry terms, cache is a set of racks where you can store a small amount of laundry. You can store laundry you just washed while it waits for the dryer to be free. Or if you have a load of blue shirts in the washing machine you can already prepare another load of blue shirts to follow so you don't have to switch settings.
Women have less hemoglobin, lower hematocrit (RBC concentration), total RBC count, and lower metabolism/caloric requirements than men. Their temperatures also fluctuate based on hormone levels more than men. I haven't directly heard that their temperatures differ, but with these differences I wouldn't be surprised, at least peripheral temperature.
The impact causes inflammation. One of inflammation's 'goals ' is to immobilize the affected area to allow for quicker healing. Hence your finger feels stiff. Edit: a word for you /u/MrsAgentDaleCooper
$97 million was spent on Oil and Gas lobbying in the United states. The United States is also rich in natural resources and is well set up for the refining of oil, meaning there is not much of an incentive for it to switch to renewable energy besides being more environmentally friendly. On top of that the European countries that are leading in renewable energy are a lot smaller both in terms of area and population, meaning they need to produce far less energy and don't have to transport it as far.
**Matter** (in the everyday sense) is made of **molecules**, which are made of **atoms**, which are made of _particles_: **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons**. That seemed to be the whole story, and that the component particles of atoms were "fundamental" — they weren't made of anything else, they were just kind of themselves. But then we found out that **protons and neutrons are actually made of smaller particles**, which are called "**quarks**". Quarks have some interesting properties. It turns out that quarks have six different "flavors" -- just intrinsically different varieties. There are only a handful of stable combinations of flavors that will last when they clump together. Other combos break down quickly or never form at all. And most importantly and weirdly, they can't be separated — they can only exist in these combos. Particles made of combinations of quarks are called, as a family, "**hadrons**". The protons and neutrons we know so well from our daily lives are the most stable combination of quarks, which are made of just two flavors called "up" and "down" quarks. These are also the most stable flavors of quarks — other flavors quickly decay into up and downs. But there are also more exotic combinations of quarks that show up as relatively short-lived particles in cosmic rays and stuff. These can involve combinations of the other four flavors of quark: "strange", "charm", "bottom", and "top". Quarks and hadrons have a lot of other interesting properties and important roles in particle physics. But to everyday human experience, the combos of up and down quarks that we know as protons and neutrons are the biggest part of the picture.
Grapevines produce an enormous amount of fruit, and it grows in bunches that are easy to harvest. Grapes are soft and easy to crush for juice. Once you have the juice, it ferments all by itself and you're drinking wine. Berries are a possibility, but you have to pick them one at a time. Blackberries and raspberries grow on thorny vines, in dense brambles. I've picked them both, and it's not a volume task. You'll get all scratched up and very weary picking a gallon of berries, and they're so tasty you'd be an idiot to crush them for a jug of hooch. Other berries, like strawberries, are mostly very recent additions to our crops. Apples produce abundantly, and are easy to pick, but getting the juice out of them is much harder than it is for grapes. A mechanical press of some sort is required. And they are the best bet of tree fruit. Stone fruits like peaches have the additional problem of a large, slightly poisonous seeds in the middle that you want to avoid crushing into the juice. Grapes have it all. Easy to grow, easy to harvest, easy to crush.
I was in middle school when Rocky Horror Picture Show first became popular; a few years later in high school, several of my friends and I went to the midnight shows on a regular basis. It was a blast. We stayed out until 3am, with parental approval, since they knew the older kids we were with. The crowd was exotic - were those actual gay people? And when the show started, the sideshow was remarkable - young people dressed up like the cast, at the front of the theater, acting out the movie as it went along. Others dressed up in the audience, participating in some sort of secret code that they were all in on... and that we learned over a few screenings. Years later a girlfriend had never seen it, so we rented it and watched on TV. It was horrible. It's a campy B-movie. TL;dr: RHPS was all about the scene that developed around the midnight shows - a counterculture where the odd, artsy kids could blend in, and if you were gay or trans, it didn't matter. Back in the late 70's or early 80's, this was a big thing, because social acceptance wasn't at the point it was today.
No. It's true that water is unforgiving when falling from a great height, but there's no such thing as "breaking the surface tension". Surface tension is a property of water, not a thing that "forms" like a film. Your best bet would still be a high-diver style efficient entry.
Heart attacks, like all things, have a cause. A heart attack may appear random, but that's simply because you didn't see it coming. Heart attacks can be reoccurring, or they can be a once in a lifetime thing, it depends on numerous factors.
Short answer: the sun is not burning. It is too hot to burn. The sun is a nuclear fusion reaction (mostly hydrogen into helium), which is far and away a higher energy than simple oxygen combustion.
Because it doesn't take weeks to cross the blood brain barrier. It gets there in mins to hours like everything else, But ssri's take weeks to change the way your brain works. Which is when you will start feeling them "work".
Defining species is a tricky and often subjective part of the various scientific disciplines which interact with it. Some will say that the viability of offspring among groups of sexually reproducing organisms is a good test, and it does offer some utility, but it is by no means exhaustive. Polar bears and grizzley bears are a famous example of two types of organisms which are generally considered different species, but which occasionally mate in wild, producing reproductively viable offspring. Mosquitos can become behaviorally different enough that they don't know how to entice mates between groups and they are often considered diferent species despite the reproductive viability of offspring created by human intervention. Archaeological evidence throws in additional wrinkles. Although we generally consider domesticated dogs to all be of the same species, if the only record we had of them were bones (ignoring DNA) we would likely consider great danes to be a completely different species from pugs. This problem rears its head when examining hominids which co-existed as it is difficult to say if these are divergent groups of one species or two separate species; some the scientists involved usually prefer the latter result as it is more prestigeous to discover a new species than just a member of an existing one. Non-sexual reproducers add additional problems as the detectable differences in species has a lot to do with how they look and how they behave around other similar organisms. DNA has added an additional tool which allows us to statistically compare gene differences between two organisms. This has been done to create base-lines of what we already feel are different species and how much their genetics deviate from each other and then we can use this to compare other similar appearing organisms, both those we can observe today and those from the relatively recent past. If they are too similar, it is a strong mark against it being a different species and if they are quite different, it is a strong mark in favor of it. In the end, the idea of 'species' is only important when it is useful in describing our world. It's useful to differentiate between predators and prey, or the reproductive viability of populations of organisms, or tracking forms of organism through the archaeological record. It is important to recognize that the walls we put up around species are not entirely sound and if we aren't careful we can make mistakes, but in so far that they are useful tools for helping us to grapple with the complexity of the world, they are just fine.
Been watching this from the beginning. It started out, as attempted revolutions do, with protests against the Assad Regime. It quickly escalated to an armed conflict. America backed the rebels and Assad responded with destruction of neighborhoods. Many people fled and many people were killed. Eventually a branch of al Qaeda started fighting Assad as well. When they had Damascus surrounded and it looked like the government might fall Iran sent troops in. Seeing an opening, ISIS moved in and seized a lot of territory in Syria and then Iraq. With the money they were making by selling oil they brought a lot of foreign fighters to the region. When ISIS was close to toppling Assad Russia joined the fight. And here we are.
When the country-specific top-level domains were created, the UK already had an academic network of its own (JANET) with its own naming scheme similar to DNS. Academic sites started  URL_1 , commercial ones started  URL_2 , and government ones UK.MOD (Ministry of Defence). The obvious thing to do was flip all the existing names around to create the equivalent DNS names. So Cambridge university was already known as  URL_1 .CAM on JANET, and was assigned the domain  URL_0  to match.
First read the question about how programming languages work:  URL_1  Games these days are all written in high level programming languages. These languages all have support for *loops*. A loop allows the programmer to make a certain behavior repeat over and over again. The programmer can put conditions on when the loop should stop (e.g., you hit the escape key, or click "Quit" on the menu). At the center of every game is a loop that repeats itself really fast. Each time the loop iterates, the entire game is updated. The computer will check whether you've pressed any butons or moved the mouse, and if so it will recalculate the positions of relevant objects in the game world. This might be simple, but it might also involve a vast physics simulation in the background which has a lot of brilliant tricks to take into account the fact that the physics is updated at discrete steps (every time the loop iterates), not continuously as in the real world (or so we assume... :D). As for how pictures get on the screen, the screen is *redrawn* every single frame. Every. Single. Frame. It's all redrawn. (And a "frame" is nothing but an iteration of the loop I talked about above.) How does the programmer actually get stuff on the screen? That's what DirectX and OpenGL are for. These are vast libraries of pre-written code that can communicate directly with the video card, which in turn has the capability of convincing the monitor to display stuff. How does DirectX know how to communicate with your video card? That's what the video driver is for. Now, finally, what does the programmer tell the video card to draw? How in the world does he figure out how to draw a 3D scene on a 2D grid of pixels? This uses [linear algebra]( URL_0 ). But forget about the details of the math. It's just a sequence of steps. Say you want to draw a cube on the screen. Now the vertices of the square exist in some arbitrary coordinate system whose origin is probably the cube's center. The first step is to translate the cube to its desired location in the actual game environment. This also involves rotating the cube or scaling it. Now we know that the player is somewhere in the environment looking in some direction. The second step is to translate and rotate the entire world according to where the player is standing and where he's looking. Ex: if the player strafes left, the world slides right; if the player is looking up, then world rotates down, around the point where the player's eyes are at. (Simplified.) I remember playing Crusin' USA on N64 when I was little, and I sometimes wondered... is the car really moving, or is the ground moving while the car is stationary? The truth is much closer to the latter! The world moves around the player. (Simplified.) The final step is to project all the transformed geometry onto a plane, which represents the screen. This produces a set of polygons on the plane to be drawn, almost always triangles because video hardware is optimized for rendering triangles. These data are then send to the video card, which then gets it on the monitor. Each of these three steps is a simple mathematical computation expressible in a unified manner using linear algebra. Video hardware is exceptionally well-optimized for performing these calcluations with triangles.
Life isn't nitrogen based, but life does make use of lots of nitrogen atoms. Life is carbon based because the structure of carbon enables lots of different variations of organic molecules. Nitrogen doesn't form the types of bonds to enable the same amount of variation.
Grape flavored soda tastes like Concord grapes. Find them. Try them. Marvel in how exact they got it right.
There are various theories explaining deja vu. A lack of research exists on the subject simply because the instance occurs infrequently amongst those that have reported experiencing it. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint this experience in someone and analyze the electrical signals in the brain. My favorite theory encompasses the idea that deja vu is essentially a delay in short term memory storage; similar to that of a computer's CPU telling the ram to store an amount of data, but the process is stalled briefly due to a hang up with other processes. The result, is an interesting feeling of 'hearing something' or 'seeing something' that is 'familiar' when in reality your brain is just playing catch up with your short term memory storage process. [Vsauce has a bit on this as well.]( URL_0 )
Since it's exactly in the middle, you need to pick *something* and be consistent about it. It's completely arbitrary, you could just as easily round down. There's also other systems of rounding that you can use. You can round towards/away from 0, you can alternate up/down on odd/even integers and I'm sure there's others. Depending on the application, the might give you numbers that are more suitable.
The main argument most people use against socialism is that you're forced to give away your hard earned money to assist other people. Key word there being forced. I personally agree with socialism to an extent; I think we should provide food, clothing, shelter and health insurance to everyone who can't afford it. I don't agree with providing cash just the necessities.
I've only heard it referred to as the Two Thousands.
from [Iowa ENT Center]( URL_0 )  > **What is a turbinate?** A turbinate is a strip of tissue along the lining of the nose. It can swell or shrink based on many factors. When swollen, it blocks airflow; when decongested, it permits airflow. The turbinate is responsible for the back-and-forth nasal blockage people experience. For instance, when one rolls over in bed and one side of the nose opens and the other closes off, it is the turbinate swelling on one side and shrinking on the other that is responsible for this change.
The short answer about this is that the US *has* officially adopted it. But nobody wants to use it. There's no public will to actually change everything over to standard units, so that doesn't happen. But if you talk to scientists, or medical personnel, they will tell you that they use metric at work.
I assume you're asking about microwave reheating? Microwaving essentially boils your food. Oils will make your food more soggy, water will evaporate, drying it out. Something crispy like a fry becomes soggy. Something moist like rice becomes dry.
First of all, I want to say that the rest of the comments on this post thus far are horse shit. The key word in this is "fantasy." These women don't actually *want* to be raped, they want to role play a dangerous situation. It's the same reason people enjoy horror movies or roller coasters- simulated danger for the sake of an adrenalin rush. For you, OP, to say it makes you lose respect for a women with rape fantasies would be comparable to women losing respect for you because of the porn you like to watch. They have control over the situation in these fantasies, it's fake. Edit: When I made this post, there were only about three other comments in this thread, and they were pretty immature. A lot of you have since made some great points.
Sounds are usually described by three characteristics - pitch, loudness, and quality (or "timbre"). Pitch is determined by frequency and describes how high or low a note is. Loudness is what it sounds like (forgive the pun - I simply mean loudness is self-explanatory). Everything else is generally categorized as "timbre," which is what allows you to tell the difference between a piano and violin playing a note at the same pitch and loudness. Quite a bit goes into timbre such as harmonic content, attack and decay, and vibrato. I don't really know enough about those to explain them further other than to say they are characteristics of sound waves that affect how you hear, but don't change the pitch or loudness. If you can find an app that lets you play around with a synthesizer, you can usually change those settings directly so you can play around with how they affect sound. Edit: There are some more technical responses below from people who know more about this than I do. Check them out for more details. And thanks to everyone who provided more details! Edit 2: Most of the comments below are saying that attack (the beginning of a sound and how long it takes to get to peak volume/loudness) and slight variations in the pitch and loudness are the physical properties that create different timbres, though the area is still being researched. Apparently when you play a note on an instrument the part of the instrument producing the note actually produces multiple frequencies and can have slight variations in loudness. The frequencies not associated with the pitch you hear are called overtones. You generally only perceive the fundamental frequency (the pitch of the note), but the overtones change how you perceive that. To bring it back to your original question, you can tell the difference between a piano and violin playing middle C because they have different attack, overtones, and the loudness during the note will change slightly. And you might not be able to tell the difference if you didn't hear the attack (the beginning of the note). As an added bonus, if I understand correctly, the different overtones result in a different spectral flux and the changing loudness over the duration of the note results in a different spectral envelope.
This can happen a couple of ways. When you have substances in your intestine that aren't being readily absorbed into the body, the concentration of the substances is higher in the intestine. Water flows from areas of low concentration to high concentration, so when there is a greater amount of a substance in your intestine, water will flow in. More water = diarrhea sometimes. Another way is in certain conditions, such as cholera, water is continuously being released in the intestine regardless of the how much there is present in the intestine. Yet another way occurs because your GI tract has a base level of motility; its continually contracting and relaxing to move the contents. Certain conditions can increase the motility, so the water doesn't have time to be absorbed, and comes out the other end as diarrhea. Essentially, there are quite a few ways diarrhea can happen, these are just a couple. Source: pre-med
I assume your talking about the recent results by [PayScale]( URL_0 ) report. Basically it is really bad reporting, turnover and tenure rate might be directly related for some companies but not for a newish company which is growing at an enormous rate. The [reported employment numbers]( URL_1 ) in 2011 where 32,467 d now in 2013 its 42,162 employees. That is an additional 9695 new employees, or 33% of the company. Think about that for the moment, 33% of the company *literally* can't have tenure greater than 2 years! To make this problem even worse, Google has only been a company for 15 years. Unlike much older companies nobody at Google can have a tenure of more than 15 years. To make this even more apparent; **TL;DR: I start a company yesterday, my company has an average tenure of 1 day, what a turn over rate I must have!**
You make and sell widgets. They are really cheap for you to make so we won't consider your costs for this example. Fred is willing to pay $6 for a widget, and Wilma is willing to pay $10, and Shaggy is willing to pay $12. What should you set your price at? If you sell at $6, all three will buy from you and your gross income will be $18. If you sell at $10, Wilma and Shaggy will buy from you and your gross will be $20. If you sell at $12, only Shaggy will buy from you and your gross will be $12. Clearly you should set your price at $10, right? If this was the only way you could set prices, then the answer would be yes. But what if you came up with some clever way of charging different prices for each person. If you could charge everybody the most they would be willing to pay, then you could make $28 instead. This is called "capturing the consumer surplus". You see this in lots of places, with things like senior citizen or child discounts (groups that would often just rather pass up something than pay full price), or with region codes on DVDs. Any time you have a chance to divide up your market you have an opportunity to capture consumer surplus. Airlines have made this into an art, deciding how much somebody is probably willing to pay based on all sorts of signals like where they are going, whether it is round trip, how many stops there are, how far in advance they are looking for a ticket, when they are flying, etc, etc. It would not be surprising to learn that every person on a flight paid a different price. TL;DR - They are making a guess at the most you'd be willing to pay based on the information they have about you.
I am a career paid Fireman. The best way to simplify it is to say that we do not ALWAYS enter a burning structure. There are quite a few common sense reasons that are a definite no go for us (such as flames through the roof, indicating a high probability for collapse on most residential fires). If there is a possibility that we can enter the structure, the incident commander has to make a decision which comes down to "risk a little to save a little, risk a lot to save a lot". If there is any chance that a VIABLE human life is inside, you can guarantee that every firefighter on the scene would risk their life without question to save the person inside. The big word there being viable. Most of the time the toxic chemicals produced by modern manufacturing give off super heated and immediately deadly fumes that can kill you after only a few breaths. We have to take that into account and will not risk as much to recover someone who has without a doubt perished. Our next goal is to save property that can be saved. Family photos and heirlooms are irreplaceable and we make every effort to minimize your loss. If I can read the conditions of the fire and make a direct attack inside the house right at the seat of the fire, it extinguishes the fire quicker, preventing extension and also limiting damage from water being shot in through Windows. Most of our nozzles put out at least 200 gallons per minute. That is a lot if water to put inside your house blindly through a window. Most kitchen fires could probably be extinguished with less than 30 gallons if there is no extension into the walls/roof. Also as others have said, there are a lot of times you can't be certain that the building is unoccupied. A lot of accidental fires happen because squatters light "camp fires" in abandoned buildings to keep warm. They have a right to be saved and us not completing a search of the building (conditions permitting) would be negligent. In residential buildings we keep our eye out for indicators of people that would occupy the structure. For instance if there is a car in the driveway then someone was likely home. Or if there are small children's toys in the yard or house then we automatically assume the possibility that we need to account for children. Sorry for any typos, I'm on mobile. Hope this helps answer your question. If you take anything away from this, just know that if there is a possibility for me or any of the firefighters I know to save a life, we will fight until our last breath to get you out safely. Edit: Thank you all for the kind words and thank you for the gold! Reading through all of your comments really brightened my day!
First imagine if we could put a gun onto a deli slicer. Then start making slices of the gun that are very thin. 1mm or less in thickness. The 3D printer works in the reverse of this. It will take something that is in liquid form, but will solidify when lowered to room temperature and exposed to air (like liquid latex, cyanoacrilate, heated up plastic). So it lays down the first slice. Then the next slice on top of it, and so forth until you have the gun (this is greatly simplified, but illustrates the concept). To shoot real bullets isn't terribly difficult. It just requires a hammer to strike a firing pin. You could make one out of papier mache as long as you had a hammer (not taking accuracy or rifling into consideration)
When you make a copy of a copy of a copy, you start to get errors. As you get more errors, you get older.
Because they can. In most instances where a team threatens to leave if the city/state/whatever doesn't build them a new stadium, they get their stadium. Lots of people rely on the team for employment, and plenty of others like the team enough that they would hate to see it leave. This results in political pressure to keep the team around.
 >  a brutal autocracy that would systematically slaughter everybody even remotely suspected of being critical of the regime Could describe almost any point in Russian history in the last thousand years. The Soviet Union was a huge step up in living standards for the vast majority of Russians compared to the pre-Soviet period. The collapse of the USSR at the end of the 80's and the capitalism-gone-mad gutting of the country in the 90's was a huge step down in standard of living from the Soviet era for many people. Remember that in the Soviet era (especially the post-Stalin period) the power stayed on, you could drink the water, your children could go to good schools and could get good jobs, the state provided healthcare and assistance for the elderly and the disabled. To use a cliche, the trains ran on time. in the 90's that all collapsed. A whole country of people who depended on the state were left at the mercy of the worst of capitalist excess. The mob ruled, nothing worked, the economy was in shambles. That's not a step up from an oppressive state. It's just the same oppression with less stability. Basically Soviet Russia had *rules*. They weren't good or fair, but if you played by the rules you could do alright. Post-Soviet Russia was the wild fuckin' west. It's why Russians approve so strongly of Putin. Him and United Russia have managed to reign in the worst of the corruption and crime and make the state functional again for a lot of people.
There are safeguards that would trigger and shut the whole thing down safely. They'd just turn off. If you're asking about potential for meltdown, that's possible but exceedingly unlikely. Even in that case, most reactors (all American reactors) are designed to meltdown as safely as possible. Most people don't know that a "meltdown" is actually a safety feature. The reactor is positioned over a huge block of cement. In the event of an uncontrolled reactor (it's still not a bomb), the heat generated melts the cement, the reactor sinks, and the cement hardens behind it, "melting down" into a cement tomb designed to contain the reactor and radiation for as long as it has to.
To understand, you need to know how language and slang has changed. Duffy used to be a word meaning ghost. Jones used to just mean some random person. And locker was . . . Well, still a locker. Originally, the term was probably Duffy Jones's Locker, which meant the grave of all the unknown ghosts of people who had died at sea. Over time, Duffy became Davey, and so the original meaning of a nameless forgotten ghost was confused. So what originally meant "The graves of the forgotten" became "The grave of this one guy."
Microbes: yes; atoms: no. With a straight, magical scaling down of a human you'd hit the resolution limits of visible light which has a wavelength of about 0.5μm. This would mean that you could see everything that can be seen with an optical microscope but atoms are a challenge even for electron microscopes. If you delve into the kind of magic that would be required to scale a human then many more problems arise. The retinal cells in our eyes just don't scale down like that. Insect cells are roughly the same size as human cells; they just have way fewer of them. That's partly why insects have compound eyes which work in a very different way from human eyes. The most fundamental problem is that the square-cube law means that you can't just scale cells or organisms and expect them to work in the same way. There's a reason that the smallest mammals are bigger than insects.
Well, the landscape of classical music changed a lot over the course of the last hundred and fifty years because there are other means of entertainment. It used to be that classical music was the music of the common man, but now it has the appearance of an aristocratic activity. Composers writing academic art music aren’t necessarily writing for a wider audience, rather they’re writing for academically trained composers like themselves. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t composers that everyone knows these days, take John Williams or Hans Zimmer for example. They’re writing for the most popular media of today just like how Puccini, Verdi or Wagner wrote for opera, which was the most popular media in the 19th century.
Note: I don't have a Snapchat, So I'll be speaking from a Reddit perspective. Disclaimer: There are so many other niches and elements of the system that I didn't touch on, simply because I didn't know about it, didn't think about it, didn't have time to mention it, or any other number of reasons. This post is just a surface scratch of why the upvote and downvote system works. Human psychology is an incredibly deep and vague subject of which I don't have nearly the credentials to really claim to know what's true and what's not. Part of it is purely because it indicates social acceptance. If someone likes your post, they upvote it. And social acceptance, if functioning correctly, should make you subconsciously feel a little good. It's built into human nature, otherwise we wouldn't be social animals. Another part of it is because it makes the system tangible and measurable, which commonly makes things more appealing to humans, as opposed to vague or entirely indeterminate measurement systems. Imagine if you wrote some blog post on some blog site: would you want it to have an indicator that simply says "This post is doing well!" with an image of a small fire next to it (and nothing at all if it does poorly), or a counter of how many views it's had? It's generally more fun to see it go from some number like 1,100 when you go to sleep, and wake up to 2,310. Even better if it suddenly made it big somehow and jumped from 1.5k to 300k overnight. Being quantifiable simply makes things feel more controllable, or at least observable. As to motivation to upvote someone else's content: A common reason is to show appreciation because it was better than the average post or comment. Maybe it made you giggle, or they provided some extremely in-depth answer, or they're a novelty account that does its job well. In any case, showing appreciation is like an honest "Thank you", and makes both parties feel good on the inside. Another common reason is to help sort out what's good and bad content. If it's ad-spam; downvote and report. If it's some fan art of something you like, or a funny post, or an interesting video, you upvote it to help others see it, and also to help a post that you like get the attention that you think it deserves. As for comments, it's the same way. When sorted by "hot" or "best", AskReddit threads almost always sort themselves out into really good comments at the top, and mediocre comments at the bottom, save for the exception when an answer is late to the party and ends up sitting at 1 karma. That sense of helping a fellow human out also triggers that feelgood sensation, because again, if being positively social benefits the species, then it's a good system for the brain to reward. ^^1 I forgot to talk about the case in which downvotes affect the user experience. Basically, it's the "negative feedback" response. So, like it seems, you downvote content that you don't like, be it because it doesn't contribute, because it might be factually wrong, because you don't think someone should see it, or because you disagree with it. In some of these cases--where you downvote because of the appropriate reasons--it ties back around to the feeling of contributing to society, which makes you feel like a necessary cog in the social machine. After all, you did your part in making that out-of-place NSFL shock link or extremely aggressive and rude comment more invisible from the eyes of the rest of the community. You've cleaned out part of the trash. In the other cases--in which you downvote because you disagree--it provides a *different* rewarding feeling, albeit more self-aligned. It might make you feel superior. It might make you feel like you're "more right" for having more karma on your post. In a very heated Reddit debate, there might be one side which is consistently negative in karma, whereas the other side is consistently positive in karma (usually due to the audience which is viewing it). The side which is positive feels like they have a group behind them, whereas the other party is a solo individual who doesn't stand a chance, and might be completely wrong. In turn, you once again feel like you've aligned with society, and get rewarded for it. --------- TL;DR it feels good to upvote content, and receive upvotes in turn. This TLDR doesn't help much. You should read the full comment. ---------- Edit: two comments have explicitly told me about their upvotes. It feels good. Let me express an honest thank you in return. This makes me even happier. (In case another example is needed, refer to this edit.) Edit 2: an insightful comment from /u/MNGrrl has prompted me to add another section to my comment---though not necessarily directly related to their comment, but rather a tangent of it which I failed to mention. It's notated with a ^^1 superscript.
Being lawfully married to more than one person at a time is disallowed everywhere in the U.S. But this only pertains to *lawful marriage.* You can engage in *holy matrimony* ('church wedding') with as many people as you want, and even beings and objects that are not people, if your church is up for that. A wedding (holy or not) by itself is not a legal marriage without a lawfully issued marriage certificate. And in some cases, even that might not be enough. For example, if you lawfully execute a second marriage in another state or county (because the first one would catch on before issuing you the license), that's *bigamy,* and the first result is that the second marriage is automatically annulled. In effect, you just can't do it, period. But it's perfectly lawful to *treat other people as spouses even if they're not legally so,* so long as you don't extend that to any act that might constitute fraud. For example, you can claim only your lawful spouse as such on tax forms, or you're committing tax fraud.

Namaskar! In Christianity the idea is common due to the presence, seemingly, of two different gods in the Christian Bible. In the Christian Old Testament there is YHVH, the ineffable God of the Hebrews who selects them as His chosen people - and no other - and who, while merciful and slow to anger, is also violent and vengeful. Then there is the god of the Christian New Testament, represented by Jesus. This god is loving, kind, merciful, never (or rarely) violent, vengeful, and so on. There have been attempts to reconcile these two depictions of the Christian idea of God and one of the earliest came from Marcion of Sinope; this idea would come to be known as Marcionism. Marcion proposed that there were actually two different gods: the true god, represented by Jesus in the New Testament; and the Hebrew god who was a separate and lower entity than Jesus and the god he represented. In this idea, Marcionism shares a link with Christian Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism is a separate following which believes that Jesus, as a manifestation of Sophia (wisdom), came from the true God's realm to deliver mankind from the clutches of the tyrannical god of the Hebrews. The god of the Hebrews, as per Christian Gnosticism, is either ignorant at best or malevolent at worst; he believes that he is the only god and his works are all that are. He forces men to submit to his will and blinds them with the illusions that are our "reality". Jesus comes from the true world to share gnosis (knowledge, enlightenment) with mankind so that we can see through the illusion that the demiurge - the Hebrew god - pulls over our eyes. He shares this with us because the true god recognizes our potential as beings who possess wisdom and power the demiurge does not have and, as such, recognizes that it is unfair that anything with such capacity does not deserve the true hell that is the wise being ruled by the ignorant or incompetent.
Banks lend out more money than they have actual money, so they're creating imaginary money that only exists on paper out of thin air. It would be illegal to put free money in their own accounts, but having someone owe you money is an asset too, so they put free money in other people's accounts. If then bank sitting on too much outstanding debt, they might bundle it up and sell it to someone else, then use that money to loan more people thin-air money.
The border between North Korea and China is defined by the Yalu river and the Tumen river. Russia deliberatly didn't want China to have control over the entrance to the tumen river because it might threaten its Far eastern shipping route cities like Vladistock in the northern Pacific. Russia has had the 18 km border since an 1860 treaty with China and it was used during the 1940s as a transit route for Soviet arms and supplies to reach the North Korean leadership. The border was deliberatly designed for strategic and commercial reasons agains't China and then utilized for Russian dominance over the North Korean regime in the Soviet period. Edit:  URL_2  This is the treaty the Qing Empire negotiated with Russia ceding territory in assistance in getting rid of the Anglo-French force that occupied Peking ( Beijing) in 1860 ( due to unequal treaties of the 2nd Opium war). the area of Fuangchuancun was given over to Russia. Its now part of China but as you can read here their are environmental issues at play as well and Russian hostility over a port that might compete with its possesions in the Russian Far east:  URL_1  Edit 2: There is a growing issue that was touched upon recently in a reuter article about growing Chinese investment in Agriculture in the Russian Far East and the ambivalence and worry in Moscow over this:  URL_0 
A few big issues have happened. 1. Nearly all the productivity gains have gone to the wealthiest fraction of society -- the top 10% and especially the top 0.01%. 2. People are competing for finite resources like homes in the best locations. If everyone else earns more, I need to earn more too or I'll end up living in a bad location. 3. People's standards for material wealth have gone *way* up. Seventy years ago it was normal to own 2 pairs of shoes and 4 outfits, no TV and no mobile phone, and *maybe* one car per family, and an 800 square foot home. Now almost no one thinks this is enough.
Antidepressants are used everywhere. [In the UK, 23% of primary care patients were prescribed an antidepressant at some point.] ( URL_0 ) I think you're conflating advertising with prevalence, but many countries specifically ban prescription medication ads. Psychotherapy is everywhere, even more so outside out of US, actually. At one point, Argentina has the highest number of psychotherapists per capita, but I'm not sure if that's still true. Part of the problem is professional designations and education don't always transfer across borders. i.e. "Therapist" is *not* a professional designation in Canada. Bottom line: sorry, the US really isn't special or extraordinary in this regard.

Bacon simultaneously appeals to all three flavors people crave-- sugar, salt, and fat. Event the scent of bacon is unique, thanks to the Maillard reaction (a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned foods their desirable flavor) It's easy to prepare, reasonably priced, and readily available in the United States, so chefs started using it's properties as a "cheat" to enhance any dish. Want to make boring eggs and toast more appealing? Add bacon. Want to make a mediocre burger taste better? Add bacon. Want to make a dessert a little less sweet and more balance? Add bacon. The salty-sweet-fat combination is irresistible to most people, not just necessarily Americans. It's just more accessible in a place like the US.
In geometry, regular polygons become closer to circles the more sides they have. In that sense, you might say a circle is a regular polygon with an infinite number of sides. Real world objects can be neither perfect circles or perfect regular polygons. Eventually imperfections will crop up, at the molecular level, if not before.
Your skull is really good at deflecting and absorbing impacts without actually taking anything beyond superficial damage. Getting hit in the face is painful and disorienting, but if the force isn't sufficient to actually cause a concussion or fracture there (usually) isn't actually much damage. The organs below the rib cage don't enjoy the same level of protection. Your brain, heart, and lungs are well defended by bone armor but the lower organs are exposed. Blows there can cause organ damage, forcefully empty the lungs, and/or fracture the "floating" ribs that aren't anchored to the sternum, all of which will drop even a skilled fighter if they take a bad body blow.

I am an executive at a smallish business (~150 employees), and therefore could be considered a business person. Here's what my days consist of: * Monitoring our suppliers to make sure that their products are being delivered to us on time and high quality. * Dealing with any issues with our suppliers, such as inability to fulfill our requests, or quality problems. * Negotiating new contracts with suppliers that get us what we need at the lowest possible price. * Reviewing evaluations our employees have done of new products to see if they'll meet our needs for less money. * Plenty of meetings with other executives at my company to make sure our segments of the business are all working together smoothly. * Review and evaluate my employees' performance, regularly deliver praise, as well as correct mistakes and educate people. Logistically speaking, what this amounts to is a lot of phone and email conversations, as well as a bunch of data analysis and building reports. These reports then feed into decision making.
Unrelated, but it's actually possible that ancient relatives of crocodiles had external ears. The bit where you'd put modern crocs' earlid muscles was greatly developed in land-based cousins called notosuchians, and even further in a subgroup called the baurusuchids. This implies they had *something* over their ears that needed to be wiggled, and they weren't exactly keeping water out of their ears regularly. So yeah. Possible land crocs with ears, big enough to hunt dinosaurs. Mesozoic be whack yo. EDIT: Unfortunately their ears were not in fact superpredators. This is why I need to grammar.

You might as well ask why anyone finds any body part attractive, because you're going to have countless people prescribing to one or another. If you're asking why certain body parts have a bigger "cult following" than others, that can be answered a few ways: -Taboo will play a role with some, wherein the body part in question is considered something that should be hidden or clothed in public and therefore gains a mysterious or taboo quality. -Association with some perceived sexual aspect, or literal use in an act of sex can make a body part easily become an analogue of sexual activity. -More primitive factors (evolutionary selection) can play a role in aesthetic preferences. It's been proposed that there is a correlation between a woman's fat distribution in her thighs and buttocks and the IQ of [her] children (higher is better). -Plus rappers like it, and do they EVER make bad decisions?
The Vietnamese were guerrilla warriors all the way and used ingenuity over might. Here are just some of the low-cost tactics they used to defeat the U.S. army: 1) When they discovered that Americans were using "jumping landmines", as in when you step on them they spring up and explode in the air, they had their scouts follow US troops and spot where they were planting them and risked their lives to dig them up...and plant them in the tops of trees to that when US copters flew over the trees, the downward pressure of the rotors would cause the mines to jump and explode at the helicopters. 2) Manipulate curiosity - The VCs noticed that many Americans had a childlike curiosity. So if they planted a Mickey Mouse doll in the middle of the jungle, troops would invariably be like "wow, what's this doing here?", pick it up and trigger a bomb. 3) Insect warfare - Living in the jungle, VCs were accustomed to seeing scorpions and tarantulas all over the place and quickly realized they freaked out Americans. If they didn't have bombs at their disposal, the VC would rig boxes full of spiders or scorpions and a trip wire would bring them down on US troops who would shriek in horror, thereby giving away their position and getting mowed down by gunfire.
Chances are that when you slept for the lesser amount of time, that although you were sleeping less, you woke up at the *correct* time. There are these things called sleep cycles which last 1 1/2 hours at a time. If you wake up after a sleep cycle you feel less groggy and more likely to feel well rested. If you sleep more, provided you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle, you tend to feel unrested and tired. This is the explanation for why people feel awful just sleeping an extra 15 minutes after waking up feeling great.
A gun is loud for two reasons. 1: any gun which fires a bullet which breaks the sound barrier is impossible to suppress without slowing the bullet. Part of the sound is the sonic boom created by the bullet breaking the sound barrier. 2: The way that a gun fires is to create enough pressure behind the bullet the push it out the barrel of the gun. There are very hot gasses which expand very quickly. A suppressor (also known as a silencer) slows the expansion of the gas outside of the barrel. If you were to disassemble a suppressor, you would see it is basically a tube with small holes that feed into another chamber. By giving the gasses a slightly larger area to expand in, it allows the gas to expand and cool at a slower rate.

There are a lot of possible explanations that have been offered, however there has been no scientific publication that narrows it down to a single one. These include: a) Exposure of body parts: Your body parts that are usually kept warm and snug in your unwashed underwears, are exposed to cooler temperatures. Your body reacts in the form of shivers to keep them warm. b) Loss of heat: Though not convincing enough, another theory goes on to say that if you urinate or micturate (man I love that word), your body loses heat, causing it to shiver. c) Mini orgasm: Yep. That orgasmic release when you've been holding it in for a long time, may in fact lead to a mini orgasm which leads to small convulsions. What usually happens is that your autonomous(edit: autonomic) nervous system keeps your bladder relaxed, while keeping your valves tensed. This is achieved by a hormonal play. When you pee you cause the valves to relax, and bladder to grow tense. This change in hormonal balance may lead to convulsions in the body. Hope that helps. :)
So first, your brain is pattern seeking. It doesn't really see a man or woman infront of them. It see's a lot of specific patterns like hip to waist ratio, eye spacing, symmetry etc. And that all makes someone attractive or not. Anime, or similar art, works by highlighting specific characteristics and usually putting emphasis on them to make them specifically attractive somehow. As for the emotional attachment, it could be partially pathos. Pathos is where the audience empathizes with the character of a story. We grow feelings for these characters. Those feelings can be internalized. Second is a sort of disconnected feeling amongst certain people. Often these people don't have a whole lot of love coming to them from real life. Either percieved or real. So they settle for what they can get, even if it is artificial. Often the artificial love is in some ways better than real life. Virtual waifu loves you unconditionally, despite your failings. Something that many real relationships don't offer.
Sorry, I know this isn't in the format of ELI5, but this is a good link that sequentially lists and rebukes all the "holes in evidence" against climate change in fairly simple terminology.  URL_0  Short of it is, the backing for human caused climate change is NOT shaky, it is accepted by 99% of practicing scientists and the evidence for it is overwhelming. Admittedly, there are problems with our responses to climate change, specifically in carbon market schemes and management / mitigation action plans, but there is no invention of a problem here. Hopefully someone other than I can follow up with a better ELI5 response.
The biggest reason you are experiencing loss of signal is due to the structural material of your building. There is a certain amount of signal loss (measured in dB or decibels) that occurs whenever a wireless signal must pass throught any object. Some building materials such as single pane glass windows, drywall and wood have a very low loss of Signal Penetration as opposed to more dense materials such as concrete, steel and brick. If you are located in the center of the building, say by the elevator, you will be struggling to get a decent signal as opposed to if you were close to an exterior wall on the same floor. There are many other factors that can cause loss of signal such as line of sight, distance and weather but aren't necessarily contributing to your specific case as you can travel a short distance outside of your building and grab a signal.
If you pay people to donate blood, you encourage people to give blood more frequently than they should, lie on their donation forms and perhaps even use aliases to give excessive amounts of blood in the short term. You are also encouraging people to give blood that ordinarily wouldn't - maybe it's not safe for them to currently do so but they need the money. This is often the reason some scientific experiments with potential side effects or harm to participants are purely voluntary and not paid. Edit: Here is some research FOR paid donations and counters the research behind the points I raised, just for the other side of the story:  URL_0 
Your edit still shows you don't get it. What they said is all there is to it. It's prestigious. And the company gets a reputation of being prestigious, which perpetuates that prestige. It doesn't matter if they're 100% identical. One has the "Gucci" tag and the other doesnt. The price is their way to "weed out" people they think are lower status than them. It's pathetically socioeconomically prejudiced but that's all it is. That is literally all there is to this.

1. The big bang only addresses the very early universe, and not the origin of the universe. 2. Since time is a dimension of the universe, the phrase "before the universe existed" makes about as much sense as "north of the north pole".
A lot of factories (where the companies don't care about the environment at all) are located inland. The winds come down from the west, across the factories, and carry the pollution into the coastal cities. But, the answer is, generally, Chinese companies don't really care about the environment.
The temperance movement sought a constitutional ban, not a legal ban, so as to prevent the ban from being easily repealed. A super-majority of the members of the 65th Congress favored prohibition -- but that was really an oddity. Many in politics opposed prohibition, and anti-prohibitionists might retake a majority at any time. The temperance movement enacted a constitutional ban to ensure that, without a 2/3 majority, Congress couldn't repeal the ban on the sale, transport, and manufacture of alcohol. Opponents of prohibition also preferred the constitutional ban -- because it didn't include any provisions for enforcement. They thought they could deliver prohibitionists a moral victory, while still using their power to block good enforcement. Ultimately, they succeeded -- alcohol was banned, but everyone still drank. Of course, this ended out being a huge disaster, but that's another matter. Daniel Okrant's *Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition* details the nitty-gritty of the prohibition battle including the risk that Congress might repeal. For the record, Congress claims the authority to regulate drugs today under the interstate commerce clause, given that most drugs include components traded across state lines, or are sold across state lines, or are sold by groups that operate across state lines, etc. etc. etc. See *United States v. Lopez* for more information.
Many flowers secrete nectar as part of their biology. They lack the ability to move pollen from the male flowers to the female flowers so they entice bees and insects with nectar with the hope the while the bees collect the nectar they also move the pollen around allowing for the fertilization of the plant species. Honey bees have a special compartment in their body to hold nectar. This compartment (called the crop or honey stomach) is designed to allow the bee nectar storage while it is foraging. When the forager bee returns to the hive she passes the nectar to a receiver bee who puts it in a wax comb cell for ripening. Nectar has a high moisture content, perhaps 40+%, but the bees want to store the honey for future consumption. They regulate the humidity in the hive via wing flapping over fresh stored nectar and move air in and out from the entrances. Once the honey is at 17/18% moisture content it is ready for capping. The bees cap the cell with wax and that honey will stay in storage until they need it. If the season goes well, the colony may collect for example, twice the amount of honey they will need for winter. The beekeeper can take that extra and this harvesting does not harm the bees at all.
You might want to check out this other reddit post:  URL_0  The long and short of it, apparently: Fingernails grow outwards at a rate of approximately 3 mm per month (0.1 mm per day). This means that the skin under our nail is pulled off by our nail so slowly that the pain receptors are not set off and we feel nothing. The microscopic tears in the nail bed heal just as quickly as they are formed, so you don't notice it. Edit: I can't seem to find a whole lot of information on this topic online.

Its because the algorithm Google uses for search is very, very good. It is, by far, the most valuable piece of IP that Google owns. Since it is so good, most people use Google as their search engine. This gives constant feedback on what results people actually want, which they use to make the algorithm more accurate.
Chimps and bonobos also have sex for pleasure. Bonobos use it as social bonding. Chimps... it's kind of just a lot of rape.

Food was rare back in the days which meant that throwing it away could have terrible consequences as long as it was still somewhat edible. Cooking possibly couldve happened by someone accidentally dropping food into a fire and because they wouldnt want to throw it away they ate it. Wine was probably similsr by forgetting about some grapes and they started fermenting. A lot of things happened most likely by accident because food was scarce and hard to come by...
Alcohol allows one inhibitions to be discarded, thus allowing ones imagination to wander over to the "uncontrolled, uninhibited" side of the imagination, thats where the best stories often hide.
Two main ways: 1. Dissecting animals sensory organs to analyze their structure (For example, we can look at the structure of rods and cones in their eyes and theorize based on that). 2. Running tests like playing high or low pitched sounds, putting them in mazes with food, etc.

The human body has 2 types of sweat glands. The first type is called an eccrine sweat gland. These are located all over the body and produce mostly watery sweat. The other kind is called apocrine sweat glands. Apocrine sweat glands are found in the armpits and groin areas. Apocrine glands make sweat that has more protein and other nutrients than sweat from eccrine sweat glands. All the proteins and nutrients from apocrine sweat are good food for bacteria. The bacteria are responsible for the odors you smell. ~~Anyone who has an old, white, undershirt can see this. Armpits turn yellow because of all the proteins and other nutrients that is in the sweat in there.~~ Edit: So I guess yellow sweat stains are actually from compounds in the deodorant itself and is unrelated to the sweat. Learn something new every day. Thanks for pointing that out.
Because heating pads are warm, they open blood vessels in the area and improve blood flow. This carries with it chemicals that can block pain and reduce swelling.
Because of the effect they have on the brain. Once you start taking them, they start giving you more energy for a brief period *before* they start enhancing your mood. So if you were suicidal before, you'll still be suicidal for a while, but now you may also have the energy to want to *do* something about it. [More info.]( URL_0 )
you guys do have fire hydrants but just like here in Australia the are not big red/yellow things that stick out of the ground but rather dug into the ground and covered by little metal plates the trucks carry the equipment to plug into them
A combination of the following (one, the other, or both, to varying degrees of limitation and/or price): * You own a website, online service, or mobile app; but Verizon slows it so it takes a long time to load *unless* you pay them. * You subscribe to the internet as an end user. Facebook and Google load slowly, Netflix and YouTube run at standard def only, and LiveLeak and BitTorrent are totally blocked. Your ping time in games is abysmal UNLESS you pay extra for a "Premium Subscriber" package. ISPs then introduce their own content services, which will of course run much faster than anyone else's over their own connections. They take all the ad revenue, and you are stuck with their service which they can do whatever they want with (including charge for it - but charge less than what they charge to use a competitor's). The original content providers slowly die off, as people don't want to pay for the "Netflix" package since they already pay for Netflix, or for the YouTube package since YouTube is supposed to be free. They make all the money and control all the information flow. Little startup companies who can't afford to pay for all their user's bandwidth? Gone. With the competition eliminated, these companies have no reason to really innovate, and the internet becomes a crappy text-based version of cable-TV: super-high subscription fees, crap content, and no freedom to innovate. It's really a shit excuse to sap as much money from people as they can, but if it happens it will cost much, much more. EDIT: One silver lining is that we may see more startup ISPs who DON'T pull this kind of crap - but that will be very difficult because the big boys provide all the "information superhighway" wires that connect the internet across long ranges, and they'll just charge the small ISPs to lease bandwidth from the big connection lines.
Imagine that you're sitting down to dinner with your family, and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal, you don't get any. So you say "I should get my fair share." And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, "*everyone* should get their fair share." Now, that's a wonderful sentiment -- indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share *also*. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any! The problem is that the statement "I should get my fair share" had an implicit "too" at the end: "I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else." But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant "*only* I should get my fair share", which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that "everyone should get their fair share," while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out. That's the situation of the "black lives matter" movement. Culture, laws, the arts, religion, and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter. Clearly, that message already abounds in our society. The problem is that, in practice, the world doesn't work the way. You see the film Nightcrawler? You know the part where Renee Russo tells Jake Gyllenhal that she doesn't want footage of a black or latino person dying, she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed? That's not made up out of whole cloth -- there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience (who are white) can identify with. So when a young black man gets killed (prior to the recent police shootings), it's generally not considered "news", while a middle-aged white woman being killed *is* treated as news. And to a large degree, that is accurate -- young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers, which is why we don't treat it as anything new. But the result is that, societally, we don't pay as much attention to certain people's deaths as we do to others. So, currently, we *don't* treat all lives as though they matter equally. Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase "black lives matter" also has an implicit "too" at the end: it's saying that black lives should *also* matter. But responding to this by saying "*all* lives matter" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means "*only* black lives matter," when that is obviously not the case. And so saying "all lives matter" *as a direct response* to "black lives matter" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem. TL;DR: The phrase "Black lives matter" carries an implicit "too" at the end; it's saying that black lives should also matter. Saying "all lives matter" is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to.
A person's net worth is the value of all their assets, minus debts.
There is a whole group of computer Operating Systems which are called 'linux' because they all use the linux kernel, which basically just means they all work in roughly the same way. The main thing that differentiates linux from the other main operating systems (Windows and Mac OS X), is that it is "free software". With other "proprietary" software, nobody except for the company that made it is allowed to modify it, make and share their own versions, or even really see how it works. If there's something you don't like about a piece of proprietary software, the only thing you can do is ask the company that made it to change it, and if they don't want to, you just have to put up with it. If you find a problem with the software, even if you are a programmer and know how to fix it, you aren't allowed to. Free software doesn't have those restrictions, so linux is worked on by thousands of programmers all over the world, many of whom are not paid to do it, they just want to make the software better. Since so many people are making improvements and fixing bugs, linux is a very stable, fast and reliable operating system. Some advantages: - You can change, tweak, customise or replace anything about your system if you want to. If you don't know how, chances are someone else has wanted the same thing as you and figured it out, so you can just use their solution. - The type of people who work on linux tend to be a little paranoid, which is a good thing because it means the code they write is very secure. Combined with the fact that fewer people use linux, this means that linux basically doesn't get viruses. - Linux and much of the software that runs on it is free, as in you don't have to pay any money for it. Apart from being cheap, this is neat because it means installing and removing software is really easy, there are no keys or authorisation systems or whatever. You can casually install some big complicated program that would have cost $100 proprietary, and if you get bored of it uninstall it 5 minutes later. - There are loads of people who love linux and like to help people learn how to use it and help solve their issues Some disadvantages: - It doesn't run software that was written for Windows or OS X (well, it often can, but not without a little bit of work). This is mostly an issue for gamers. - Getting the most out of it, using the more advanced features, modifying it etc, requires you to know about computers - Because so many different people are working on different programs, there are a lot of options and variations. I think it's good to have choice, but it can be confusing.
Raping is also a part of some cultures. So is cutting hands off for theft, so is death by stoning for homosexuality. Doesn't make those things right/respectable just because it's a different culture. Respecting a different culture is generally said in reference to differences in clothing, language, lifestyles, food, appearance etc. Getting two children married to each other basically takes away their right to make an informed, rational decision by themselves. Arranging a marriage without informed consent is one of the worst things you could do to a person. It is simply wrong whichever way you look at it. A practice like that doesn't enrich any culture in any way, it's simply evil and unnecessary in this day and age.
Cats have some nuances in their behaviour that a lot of humans tend to overlook or misinterpret as lack of affection or being aloof. One thing that a cat will do to display that they are comfortable around you, is look away from you. This lets you know that they do not perceive you as a threat. This is often accompanied by a slow blink where they half close their eyes. If you reciprocate that slow blink and slightly turn your head away, it will show them that you feel the same. If you pick a cat up or approach it in a manner that is very direct, they can interpret this as threatening behaviour. Some cats like to be picked up, some don't. That's kind of dependent on how they were raised. I have a kitten that I'm fostering, and he will come over which I call him with a particular sound or if I make eye-contact and slow-blink. The problem is that a lot of people try to interpret cats in the same way as dogs. Dogs operate a lot like humans in their social structure, which is why we get along so well. For cats, we need to learn to adapt to how they socialise, because our methods do not have as much in common. So, to address your initial question: A cat is more affectionate when you are ignoring them, because they perceive you as less threatening and see you as being more comfortable with them.
That is just how governments work. I don't drive, but my tax money goes to build roads for people who do. I don't have children but my tax money still goes to public schools. I've never had a house fire but my tax money is still used to fund fire departments. Healthcare funding is no different. It's also a bit of a fallacy to assume everyone who is unemployed is a deadbeat slacker. Some people are simply unable to find sustainable work, despite trying their hardest whether it be due to a disability or simply bad luck. I currently have a great job and a comfortable salary, but I was unemployed for a long time after college because I simply didn't get any calls back, no matter how many places I applied or how hard I worked to polish my resume.
If you check [here]( URL_0 ) with the good folk of /r/askscience they'll tell you there's little evidence that they are harmful. A lot of it is to do with Monsanto. A huge company who are heavily into it who are a very disagreeable company with questionable ethics in some areas. Add in the fact that papers love to scare us dumb folk into thinking harmless things will kill us. Add in a nice bt of mad scientists trying to pervert nature and its a hack's wet dream.
It's not starvation that morbidly obese people will die of when they literally stop eating. Its malnutrition. The body stores any energie it does not use in the form of fat. Energie intake can be done via different sources: carbohydrates, proteins, and fat. Note, we need all of the aforementioned in various degrees, but in western societies, they are heavily over consumed. Vitamins and minerals don't supply us with energy, but are necessary to perform functions, such as potassium is needed to flex a muscle. Vitamins and minerals can't be stored by the body, and an overconsumption of these will leave the body via excretion or fecal matter, or can even poison the body. Malnutrition is observed in lots of poor third world counties, but also in Western societies. It is because of people are not conscious of what their body needs. Here is an analogy for your morbidly obese person: an African child gets to eat nothing but a cup of rice each day. The cup of rice gives the cild the energy it needs. Energy alone however, is not enough. It also needs its vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, proteins and others to have all its cells perform its functions. The child does not have a healthy intake of vitamins and minerals, and slowly, its body functions are shutting down. The morbidly obese person has plenty of fat storage to provide the body with energie, however, the body does not need all this energy, it needs other nutrients, the obese person is not taking in, so it dies.
The short answer is because outlets are only designed to draw so much current and adding power strips makes them more likely to draw a dangerous amount of current.
First, it's important to note that both of these are generally derogatory terms used to put down the political opposition. As such, you'll often see them miss used or applied in odd ways. Nationalism: the belief that your nations interests must come first, regardless of the effects on other people or nations. A nationalist would be in favor of strictly limiting refugee intake if there's a risk terrorism or instability, regardless of how small that risk is. Globalism: the belief that nations must act to benefit everyone, even if it comes at the detriment of the nation enacting the policy. A globalist would be in favor of expanding the number if refugees allowed into the nation, even if it resulted in some economic or safety risks.
It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories. Polar bears diverged from the rest of the *Ursus* genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring. Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. Since polar bears are quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species. Doves and pigeons are another example. There are 310 species of birds within the *Columbiformes* order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring. Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences. The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time. **Tl;dr:** while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring. A better way of thinking about it would be: "if two populations are unable to interbreed, they cannot be considered the same species". This doesn't necessarily preclude two species from being able to interbreed.
It's just a cost issue. A lot of luxury cars have them already. As the price drops we will see them more in cheaper cars.
Because neither of the users you are hearing this from know what the fuck they're talking about
The news media hypes a lot of this stuff to high hell. Most of these announcements should be properly read as "In a lab somewhere, scientists found that this may be true". Of course this makes for an unattractive headline. So you get people blowing stuff way out of proportion.
Say you have a seed. Deep down in the genetic code of the seed is the simple genetic code that says "have these cells build more of themselves." If you let all those cells grow, the ratio between old cells and new cells will usually be the golden ratio. The golden ratio is so common in nature because it is the product of such a simple idea: the ratio between the first thing and the second thing is the same as the ratio between both those things and a third thing. It's what you always get when you tell cells or leaves or branches or scales to just "grow more of yourself."
 URL_0   > Small bubbles can block capillaries in vital organs, most urgently the brain, causing anything from pain and inflammation to neurological damage and paralysis. A small bubble impedes blood flow the same way a solid obstruction would — the bubble's surface tension relative to its size is too great for the force of blood to break it up or shove it along. Bad? Yes. Fatal? Probably not, although see below.  > A big bubble, on the other hand, gets us into the vapor lock scenario. Your heart, like the fuel pump in an old car (cars with modern fuel injection work differently), is a simple mechanical device. In ordinary operation, its contracting chambers squeeze the blood out and force it through the circulatory system. All is well. Now imagine a massive air embolus shows up and your heart starts squeezing on that. There's nothing to get any purchase on; the air just compresses. Blood flow stops, and eventually so does your heart.

Many lesbians feel, right or wrong that straight men still try to hit on them whereas straight women like the fact that gay men do not try to make advances on them. Obviously this isn't true for all men and women, men have platonic female friends all the time and women hit on gay men all the time too.
Nobody knows exactly why we yawn. It is not as good as getting oxygen to your lungs as actual breathing. The closest anyone has ever gotten to explain it is that it is something social. If you yawn when you see someone else do it, you're subconsciously communicating that you both belong to the same group and are not a threat. "See, I yawned, I'm just as tired as you. Don't see me as a threat"
1) Less atmospheric pollution. 2) Not as tied to transportation networks. 2a) Allows building in more remote areas. 2b) Not as subject to potential issues of transportation failures. 3) Possibly perceived as not being reliant on foreign imports. edit: As per BunchOAtoms, 4) Long term total cost of ownership may be lower (i.e. it is supposedly [slightly cheaper to run]( URL_0 )).
A battery isn't simply 'storing electricity' the same way a glass stores water. The electricity that flows to a battery is used to reverse a chemical reaction. The electricity is converted into chemical potential energy. This is the part that takes some time. Since it isn't a 100% efficient process, excess heat is generated. If you were to charge the battery super quickly, bad things would happen. When the battery is being used to power something, the chemical potential energy is being converted back into electrical energy.
A lot of the talk about "Social Security running out" seems to be based on two misconceptions. First is that Social Security and its trust fund are the same thing. For decades, SS was taking it more money than it was paying out, so the surplus was invested in treasury bonds - that's the trust fund. Depending on how you calculate things, we either just passed, or are about to pass, the point where SS is paying out more than it's taking in, so the program has to start taking from the trust fund to cover current benefit levels. If nothing is changed, we'll completely deplete the trust fund in 25 years or so. However, people will still be paying payroll taxes towards SS, so the program won't have run out of money. The second misconception seems to be that retirees are guaranteed certain benefit levels, so once the trust fund runs out, they'll still be entitled to the same amount of money, and we'll either have to borrow money from somewhere to keep the program going, or SS will have to go bankrupt. That's not true, either. The current law is that once we lose the trust fund, benefits will automatically be cut so that the money paid out doesn't exceed the money coming in. The current projections show that at the point where the fund runs out, that will be equivalent to about 75% of the benefits paid out while it was being subsidized by the fund. So, if the law isn't changed at all, you'll still have Social Security checks coming to you when you retire, it's just that it will be less than what your parents and grandparents received. Chances are good, looking at how it's worked in the past, that some change will be made once people get panicked enough over it.
First, that is not a law. Second, many countries have not signed or ratified. Third, in the US at least, you can hire unpaid interns only if certain criteria are met. * The internship is similar to training/education which would be given in an educational environment. * The experience is for the benefit of the intern. * The intern does not displace regular employees but works under close supervision of existing staff. * The employer providing the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded. * There is no guarantee of a job at the conclusion of the internship. * Both parties understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the internship. Edit: a word
If you body is doing a lot of work, it needs all the energy it has, digesting food takes energy, so getting rid of it allows more energy to be used for task at hand. Sort of a fight or flight response.
Nuclear engineer here. This is hard to really explain all the details involved. But here is the short answer. A reactor doesn't make electricity, it makes steam. The turbine and generator make electricity. So if they can't work, then you can't make electricity. During normal operation, the main generator will power the plant. After a reactor scram, there isn't enough steam to run the turbine generator, so your electric systems now need offsite power or emergency generators. Every plant has one auxiliary feed pump that runs on either steam, or diesel fuel....or they have a passive cooling system that can run for a short time. (Hours). These are meant to buy time, they aren't a final cooling solution. They will either run out of water or overheat if you don't get power back eventually. For reference: Fukushima unit 1 had failures cause it's passive and steam powered cooling system to be unavailable. Unit 2 used its small steam powered cooling pump until it over heated and failed 70 hours later. Unit 3 used its large steam powered cooling pump until it depleted the reactor's steam inventory 32 hours later and began to overheat and stall, finally failing. So we do use reactor decay steam to run auxiliary feed pumps, but ultimately you need to restore normal decay heat removal to bring the plant to cold shutdown. Also. The reactor doesn't explode. The core will melt. And the metal will rust so rapidly, that it absorbs O2 from water, leaving H2 (explosive hydrogen gas) that can later get outside, mix with oxygen, and explode. But that's not a reactor explosion.
He invaded and occupied major industrial military producers, like Czechoslovakia. Read this from Wikipedia... "In a speech delivered in the Reichstag, Hitler stressed the military importance of occupation, noting that by occupying Czechoslovakia, Germany gained 2,175 field cannons, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft artillery pieces, 43,000 machine guns, 1,090,000 military rifles, 114,000 pistols, about a billion rounds of ammunition and three million anti-aircraft grenades. This amount of weaponry would be sufficient to arm about half of the then Wehrmacht.[9] Czechoslovak weaponry later played a major part in the German conquests of Poland (1939) and France (1940) - countries that had pressured Czechoslovakia's surrender to Germany in 1938." Edit: I said invaded and occupied, but Austria was sympathetic and became German through an Anschluss plebiscite. Czech Sudetenland and the Skoda arms factory was gifted to Germany through the Munich Agreement in an appeasement move. This is all covered by commenters below.
I'm only a first year studying educational psychology, but I'm pretty sure this relates to Lev Vygotsky's ideas about language. Language is one of the most important mental tools, as it plays a major role in socialisation as well as cognition. We use it to regulate our thoughts and structure our intellectual activity. When you use the voice in your head to narrate a thought process, it's called private/ internalised speech. This can be observed in young children, who often talk to themselves aloud to help them work out a problem. This is gradually internalised as a child develops, but even as an adult sometimes reading something out loud can help you understand it.
So there seems to be a little confusion with the relation between the two. This is because they stand for two different aspects of work and horsepower is calculated based on the torque. Torque is strictly measurement of force. Torque is defined specifically as a rotating force that may or may not result in motion. It's measured as the amount of force multiplied by the length of the lever through which it acts. For example, if you use a one-foot-long wrench to apply 10 pounds of force to a bolt head, you're generating 10-pound-feet of torque. Horsepower is defined as the amount of energy required to lift 550 pounds, one foot, in one second. From this definition you can see that the components of horsepower are force, distance and time. The measurement of torque is stated as pound-feet and represents how much twisting force is at work. If you can imagine a plumber's pipe wrench attached to a rusty drainpipe, torque is the force required to twist that pipe. If the wrench is two feet long, and the plumber pushes with 50 pounds of pressure, he is applying 100 pound-feet of torque (50 pounds x 2 feet) to turn the pipe (depending on the level of rust, this may or may not be enough torque). As you may have noticed, this measurement of torque does not include time. One-hundred pound-feet of torque is always 100 pound-feet torque, whether it is applied for five seconds or five years. **So, if you want a quick answer to the difference between horsepower and torque, just keep in mind that horsepower involves the amount of work done in a given time, while torque is simply a measurement of force and is thus a component of horsepower**. To see how torque and horsepower interact, imagine your favorite SUV at the base of a steep hill. The engine is idling and the gear lever is in the "Four-Low" position. As the driver begins to press on the throttle, the engine's rpm increases, force is transmitted from the crankshaft to each wheel, and the SUV begins to climb upward. The twisting force going to each wheel as the vehicle moves up the hill is torque. Let's say the engine is at 3,000 rpm, the gear ratio is 3, and the vehicle is creating 300 pound-feet of torque. Using the following formula, we can calculate horsepower: Take the torque of 300 multiplied by a shaftspeed of 1000 (3000 rpm divided by a gear ratio of 3) for a total of 300,000. Divide 300,000 by 5,252 and you get 57.1 horsepower that the SUV is making as it begins to ascend the hill. **It is interesting to note that, since 5,252 is used to calculate horsepower by way of torque and shaftspeed, it is also the number in the rpm range at which torque and horsepower are always equal. If you were to view the horsepower and torque curves of various engines, you would notice that they always cross at 5,252 rpm**. At low speeds the transmission's gears work to transmit maximum torque from the engine to the wheels. You want this because it takes more force, or torque, to move a vehicle that is at rest than it does to move a vehicle in motion (Newton's 1st Law). At the same time, once a vehicle is underway, you want less torque and more horsepower to maintain a high speed. **This is because horsepower is a measurement of work done and includes a time element** (such as wheel revolutions per minute necessary to maintain 75 mph). So to answer your I.E. a high torque number means the engine produces a lot of force. This is useful for moving more weight. That's why heavier older muscle cars need high torque while smaller lighter rice burners can get away with much lower torque. *Fun fact: Electric motors like that in the Tesla produce maximum torque at 1rpm. Most of this information was taken from and edited from [this article]( URL_1 ) from Edmunds. Edit: Here is a graph detailing a power curve of a Tesla motor.  URL_0 
u shoud buy potatoes and bury them, then theyll multiply and you can sell them and get twice the money
The OP's question should really be: What the heck is going on in Russia? The Russian economy has taken a nosedive due to being under heavy sanctions by Europe and the US. These sanctions were put on them for invading Crimea plus for Russia's involvement in the commercial airliner MH17 being shot down in Ukraine in July 2014. MH17 was heading to Amsterdam (with mostly European passengers aboard), and therefore Europe responded harshly to the incident. After these sanctions were placed on Russia, inflation went out of control in Russia. Almost overnight the cost of goods doubled in Russia. These things have had a negative impact on Vladimir Putin's approval ratings. At first, the Russian people loved Putin for invading Crimea. However, after years of economic turmoil, Putin's approval ratings are starting to slip. Furthermore, Russia's federal reserve is quickly running out if money. The Russian government is due to completely run out of money by the end of 2017. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that Western nations still refuse to lend Russia any money. Putin is digging himself into a deep hole. He is pressuring the West to drop the sanctions so Russia's economy, and indirectly his approval ratings, can rebound. Unfortunately for Putin, the West refuses to drop the sanctions. So Putin is quietly using his military to put pressure on the West. By flexing Russia's military muscle, Putin is basically saying to the West "ease up the sanctions or I may have to do something else to keep my people happy". If Europe and the US refuse to play ball with Putin, there is a good chance that Russia invades Ukraine. Annexation of more territory would greatly boost Putin's approval ratings at home (which is really all that matters to Putin). Vladimir Putin is a dictator and he will do everything he can to remain in power, no matter what the cost. Invasion of Ukraine may be his only option if Europe and the US refuse to ease up on their sanctions. It is a very scary situation. As long as Vladimir Putin maintains his control over Russia, the entire world is at great risk.
Production costs for most reality shows are extremely low, making those kinds of shows a lot more profitable than traditional programming.
A well disciplined square formation was absolutely very effective against cavalry (although by no means immune) but only if done right. First, there's no flank or rear to attack, which is the ideal tactic when using cavalry. In a square formation, all your weapons are facing outward. Second, horses have the same self preservation instinct as humans but without military training, and and such, they won't willing run into volley fire or a wall of bayonets. A well timed square could catch a cavalry charge off guard and take large numbers of them out with volley fire and impale the rest with bayonets. The flip side is that a poorly timed or executed square could quickly turn into a death trap. If the square formed too early or didn't time their fire correctly, the cavalry could regroup at a safe distance and harass them back with their own fire. Worse, infantry support could surround the square and attack or hold them in place under artillery fire.
They've done some SCIENCE on this and it turns out whenever you cross some kind of threshold, like a doorway, your brain does a kind of reset. This is presumably so when you leave your house you need to start being aware of lions or whatever.  URL_0 
I'll share one philosophy - Some people don't want to own a car. They want a "new" car every 3 years. So they lease a top of the line model and a few years later they get a new one. Not everyone seeks the satisfaction of owning a car. Many people are perfectly happy to give it back in exchange for a new car and a new lease.
I can't exactly explain the science behind night terrors, but I can recount the experience of having them as a very young child. The one that is most memorable happened when I was around 4 or 5 years old. My bed faced a window and it was often the source of strange shadows and lights that scared me before bed. When this particular night terror began I was first jolted awake with a very bright light shining through the window. My eyes opened wide and something like a "ghost witch" appeared to be flying towards me through the window. There was loud noises like thunder behind her. I turned away to flee and realized my arms and legs wouldn't move. The feeling you get when a limb falls asleep; that's how my entire body felt. The most intense sense of my limbs having fallen asleep. When I looked at my hands I noticed there were shackles pinning me to the bed. Except they were bright, like electricity. It was as if they were shocking me and that was the feeling in my limbs. I turned back to the window and the witch was now only feet away from me. She was staring right at me and was very bright. I felt like I was going to die. She opened her mouth and let out the most ear piercing screech I have ever heard in my life. I screamed in response and closed my eyes. Moments later my parents rushed in my room. There were other ones I remember. This was the worst and most memorable. It was over 30 years ago, but I remember it vividly. They are truly terrifying. I could not imagine living with them as an adult. Your entire body just goes into overdrive. Everything was bright, loud, painful and I felt like I was going to die the entire time. My understanding is that part of night terrors are accelerated heart beat, pupil dilation, sweating and fear. I don't know if that's what causes everything to be so bright and loud or if your mind is just perceiving these dreams as real and responds to them physically. Sadly, my daughter suffered from them as well. She had bad sleepwalking as well, which I understand to be a related disorder. edit: can't spell
The choice between "a" and "an" is based on how the word sounds, not how it's spelled. If it starts with a vowel *sound*, then we use "an". We pronounce "United" like "Yunited", so it's "a United States ship", but it's "an unsinkable ship".
It's actually less random than you perceive it to be. You have an incalculable amount of information floating around in your head, but obviously you don't need access to it for the overwhelming majority of your existence. It's just sitting there, waiting to be called upon or activated, which can happen quicker than a ray of light. One of the major ways we learn things is through association. If this, then that. Your brain forms tiny little connections between stimuli* and outcomes, which might seem "random" or even arbitrary. For example, whenever I hear my niece's dog Stacy suddenly get up from lying down on the couch, the bell on her collar rings and moments later her Mom walks through the door. I start to associate the bell with her mom coming home. This is a ELI5 version of classical conditioning, but I hope you take my meaning. The point is that it's not a conscious thing, and it can happen with stuff like "I heard this song while I was jogging once, and I saw a person jogging which reminded me of the song." We don't always catch these things, because again, they can seem so disjointed and "random" to us when we consciously consider them. You might find yourself listening to a song on YouTube one day and suddenly something in the video reminds you of this comment. The mental assocation happens so fast, and in an mmmbop it's gone, but you find yourself at the end of the song wondering why you're thinking about Reddit comments. *EDIT: Said stigma. Meant stimuli. Thanks to /u/mdilty for knowing where all the cowboys have gone, who let the dogs out, and other valuable information as well.
It's to get more of that demographic into your store. Movie theaters, for example, often give discounts for children to make it more affordable for families to attend. Same for senior citizens who are on a fixed income. Since they make their profit at the concession stand, it works out well for them.
Working in aged care, you get to know the signs. What doctors and nurses call "work of breathing" gets harder. The sounds of their breathing get either slower, or raspier, or shallower. Sometimes it sounds like they are snoring. Blood begins to not circulate as well, so the extremities (fingers and toes) get colder and turn faintly blue. Capillary refill is extremely sluggish - if you press the end of the finger or toe and release it, the finger or toe remains white for much longer. The heart tends to beat more slowly and with less force, the different sounds of which can be detected with a stethoscope. Consciousness may fade in and out. The brain starts to shut down, and hallucinations are quite common. The eyes may track objects we can't see, they may speak to people who are not present. Generally speaking, there's no deathbed confessions or last words, they usually slip into unconsciousness some hours before death and everything just slowly winds down. It's not uncommon for the kidneys to stop producing urine, although I do remember helping my mother in law to use a commode about an hour before she died. Usually we apply a continence pad, but it's almost always clean and dry due to digestive processes having stopped. Usually the appetite and thirst mechanisms have closed down up to several days before they die. We offer food and water in small amounts, but it's more for the comfort of the family than the patient - the digestive system stops working and they just don't want to eat. As I told one family who wanted to give their mother food so that she wouldn't die - they don't die because they are not eating, they don't eat because they are dying. There is no hunger, but the mouth can sometimes feel dry so we will often swab the mouth with glycerin swabs for comfort, and apply lip balm. They tell us hearing is the last sense to go, so even if the loved one appears unconscious, it doesn't hurt to say "I love you" one last time. It is a privilege to care for someone at the ultimate end of life, and I know I for one do not take it lightly. Our elders have sometimes been in our care for years or even decades, and can be like family to us. I have shed tears leaving someone's room for the last time. I have hugged their family and felt their loss as my own. I have worked in my current job for over 8 years, and there is now only one resident left who was there when I started, but over a hundred have gone in the meantime. I remember them all.
Acupuncture in it's "pure" form is complete bunk. Studies have been done and found that poking needles into "chi points" vs. random points gives the same effect. If the human body has "chi points", they aren't particularly responsive to being poked. Interestingly, however, the effect in both cases is not zero. The process does have a positive effect in some people. I haven't seen any studies which show whether this is pure placebo effect or if there is some other mechanism of action going on (or both).
There is no "exact time" when you fall asleep. Falling asleep is a gradual process where brain activity across many different areas of the brain slowly shift into sleep over many minutes.
Think how frustrated you feel when it's the middle of the night and you're nervous and can't get back to sleep. You're kind of tired, but you can't shut off the anxious thoughts. Focusing on going to sleep is a skill that has to be learned. You can *make* any baby go to sleep, but the trick is to have them "choose" to do it. If they aren't taught the skill of going to sleep, they won't know how to do it.
As I understand it, sacred geometry claims mystical or spiritual significance to shapes. Mathematicians think it's "wrong" because they believe that there is no evidence for these claims. As a consequence, they feel that sacred geometry has nothing to do with mathematics. Furthermore, you'll find many scientists, mathematicians and psychologists go further than simply considering a pseudo-scientific claim "wrong", but they will get actively perturbed by it. I find I'll do this as well. I think there's an analogy to free jazz or contemporary art. These fields are complex and nuanced, and you need to understand a good deal to appreciate them at all. To a layman free jazz might sound like indiscriminate tooting, and contemporary art may be reduced to a man nailing shoes to a wall and calling it art. Sacred geometry is akin to that layman getting on stage at a free jazz show and making noise with his saxamaphone or nailing his shoes to a wall at an art exhibit; he perceives no difference between what he does and what the artists do because he never actually understood what the artists do in the first place. You, as a professionally trained and dedicated free jazz musician or contemporary artist, have dedicated your life to this field and find the layman's performance a celebration of ignorance. To you it seems disrespectful that the layman has so little faith that there are deep levels of meaning to your artform, simply because he cannot perceive them. It feels like an effort to reduce your way of life to a gimmick. So, beyond not believing in sacred mathematics, you'll likely find mathematicians outwardly derisive and hostile to the idea because they perceive it to be not just incorrect, but a mockery of the great catalogue of understanding compiled by centuries of geniuses who dedicated their lives to it.
Well for one no man has even been a woman and vice versa so it really is impossible for anyone to say the only factual thing thing we can say though is that woman can orgasm multiple times in one sex session while men can usually only do once sometimes twice, Imo men enjoy their orgasms just as much but they only get the one and when it happens the sex is usually over so it's a bittersweet moment. Females get to spend the whole time trying to orgasm as much as possible while males spend the whole time fighting the orgasm for as long as possible.
Who says they don't? First thing I do as soon as I get home is take them off.
Actually, it's very simple, two kinds of people pay for online porn: - People who simply do not know about the possibility of getting it for free on streaming sites. - People who want access to higher quality videos. I mean, have you looked at the video quality on (most) free streaming porn sites ? This alone is a huge factor. I'd add something about the wrongness of explaining the online porn industry to a 5 year old, but that'd be too easy :)
MONEY. The physical transportation of food might be "easy" (to port cities at least), but it isn't free. Transportation has cost. And while you might assume that a big semi-truck can travel a mile a minute anywhere in the USA, it ain't going NOWHERE through the jungle. Where it CAN go, it still needs to fill up it's gas tank. Your grocery store has all sorts of food, even super-expensive "organic" food because you can pay for it, and the USA government subsidizes food. The farm bill is around the half a **tril**lion. Which is you paying for it via taxes. Potaytoe patawtoe.  > So I'm curious as to what exactly is stopping the distribution of food to these countries? Business who do things for profit can't make any money shipping food there. So they don't. Yeah. Poverty. Buying the food, transporting it to a place of poverty and famine, and selling it for as much as you could would still be an act of charity. Which is something we do. Because in a general sense, the developed world feeds the hungry out of the kindness of our heart and/or thirst for global domination. We give places a ton of money to buy our food. [Foreign aid, specifically to Yemen is about half a billion this year.]( URL_0 ). Of course we're also selling planes and bombs to the Saudis, who I believe just got done bombing the hell out of them. War often leads to poverty. And corruption means a lot of that foreign aid doesn't quite get into the hands of the people who are hungry. Also, there's an ugly side to foreign aid. Imagine you've got a nation down on it's luck. Like.... they didn't get much rain and all their crops failed. Sucks to be them. Bunch of starving people. Uncle sam comes through and gives everyone food. Great right? (And it really is for a lot of people). BUT. That has some nasty side-effects. All those farmers who has a terrible year now have a crop again next year.... but people have a bunch of free food from uncle sam... Why would they pay for food? The free food program is a real kick in the pants to the farmers. The exact industry that would help fix the problem. If you give them cash, that's where corruption comes in. If you give them "coupons" to buy food, typically from our food suppliers, that's exactly the same as giving them food.
First of all, very *very* few Youtubers make any significant amount of money, and the amount the top Youtubers make still pales in comparison to the top tier of other entertainment professions, such as music, TV. Youtube generates revenue by selling advertising space, mostly in the form of pre-roll, which are videos that you watch before a Youtube video plays. While this ad space is sold for a seemingly small amount *per view*, Youtube generates *four billion* views a day, and has over one billion users. A third of the internet users on Earth. Even at pennies per view, that's a tremendous amount of money and Youtube is able to pay all the Youtubers with the change they scrape from underneath their couch cushions.
When you develop a popular software, you'll constently improve features and correct bugs (much more demand than for an obscure release). As mainly your software will be distributed through various hosting sites (good to reach a wider audiance), if you release often a full package, you'll have to updates many sites. Having a download that would not change (he only download a file), mean that when you release a new version on your home server, you don't have to upadte any site, as the downloader will take the source from only one location.
Since 2013, youtube doesn't preload the entire video anymore thanks to a feature called "DASH playback" (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). It makes youtube less of a bandwidth hog by only preloading a small portion of video at a time. You might be able to disable DASH via a plugin:  URL_0

You're most likely to have some sort of accident during takeoff and landing. This is also why your tray tables have to be up and you can't have laptops during these times: ease of evacuation. If your seat is back, and something happens and the plane needs to be evacuated quickly, you just made it harder for the person behind you to get out. Edit: I've gotten this message lots of times, and as has been beautifully explained, your window thing has to be up so, in the event of an emergency, emergency personnel can see into the plane/you can see a fire, should there be one.
This is 2 questions. You pretty much posted the answer to why knots can be associated with stress. That is, prolonged tension, overuse, and poor positioning can basically damage muscle fibers which is one of the several mechanisms which most professionals generally agree can lead to knots (myofascial trigger points). Stress can cause these because it puts the person persistently in a "fight or flight" mode. The brain may respond with a hormone release (norepinephrine  &  others) which has a cascading effect through the body that results in tense muscles and postures. Your brain is basically saying hey body, you need to be ready to react and move, so be a little tense. If it lasts a long time it is thought to cause possible damage to muscles. This damage may become evident as knotted areas in muscle fibers. This is of course an oversimplification, and knots can be a subject of debate when it comes to scientific evidence. I hope this helps when it comes to a possible theory.

The consensus seems to be that making your opponent call 'Uncle' was evokative of forcing him to call out for an authority figure for help, embossing his weakness, or from a Roman tradition where one's uncle was in the same social stratum of one's father, establishing a mocking level of personal power.

Shows get money from advertising and product placement. In a regular produced show you have lots of actors. For a gameshow you really just have the host making them a lot cheaper to produce. Shows that give away large prizes like a million bucks use insurance. They know that only a few people a year are going to win the $1 million. Things like cars and TVs are off-set because the show is also used as an ad. The Price is Right always spends a few seconds telling you about the FABULOUS NEW FUSION FROM FORD! Ford provides the car for free or cheap because they get an ad out of it.
I think every generation confuses and appalls previous generations. They called Elvis the devils music, but is now beloved by grandmothers. And now that my friends have teenage kids, seeing the thing they do shocks me. But then i realized that i was doing the same stuff at that age. Maybe the perception of the younger generations is just a reaction to how old they make them feel.
Imagine your nerves controlling sight as a sidewalk in a neighborhood. Normally, there's a normal supply of people walking on it and everyone stays on the path. Sometimes, there's a huge burst of people (looking at something bright). The sidewalk is so crowded that some people end up stepping on the lawn of the neighboring houses. Mr. Sneeze, living in one of the houses, sees this and gets out of his house to yell at the people to get off his lawn. The process is known as photic sneeze reflex and it affects 18-35% of the population. The mechanics behind it are not fully understood but it may be due to nerve signals being confused when there is a rapid burst from seeing bright light.
It's ultimately because the military has many laws that are specific to the military; sedition, mutiny, and failure to obey a lawful order being just a few of them. These aren't civilian crimes, so the military needs legal authority to prosecute these charges. In the event that a servicemember commits a typical crime, let's say getting drunk and assaulting someone, the civilian legal system will get together with the military legal system and determine in which court to prosecute (typically it will end up in the civilian court if the crime was not committed on a military installation). When the crime is committed off-base, the city/county has jurisdiction. They can then choose to hand over jurisdiction to the military, or they can maintain jurisdiction and prosecute normally.
Communism - Everyone contributes to the system equally, everyone takes out equally **Doesn't work because**: not all jobs are equal. Why should I spend 40 hours a week shovelling dog shit, and get the same amount of reward/food as you get to be a chocolate taster? Why should I spend 8 years training to be a doctor, while you only spend 18 months learning to be a chef? More importantly, why would anyone do the hard/rubbish jobs, if they could do an easier/more pleasant job and still get the same house etc as everyone else? Some people would be willing to, for the sake of society, but many would not At it's most simple, communism is too fair. It would work very well if we could truly split the work that needed to be done, and the rewards into equal chunks that everyone did the same. If we all spent a day as a doctor, a day as the shit shoveller, a day as the chocolate taster, and then had a day sat on the sofa with the iPad, we might all think it was fair and be happy. In reality, we can't make things this neat so some people (usually the ones with the most highly required skills that we can't do without) will dislike the system. Similarly it's open to abuse since lazy people can just slack off and let others do the work Socialism - Does work to a far greater extent. Most of Europe, for example, is far more socialistic than the US or many other parts of the world. When taken to the same extent as communism (ie traditional socialism), it fails for the same reason as communism: it can't be fair enough. Note that this is traditional socialism, however, where things like manufacturing are all under the control of the state, prices are controlled etc. There is an alternative which does seem to work better: Modern Socialism. Modern Socialism, is a kind of fairer-fairness. Instead of everyone putting in the same and taking out the same, it's kind of weighted. You still get rewarded more if you have greater skills or put in greater effort, but some things that are seen as belonging to everyone, are paid for by everyone. Think of it more as a "We all contribute some of our income, we all gain from the shared result" rather than "we put everything in and all get the exact same out". For example energy companies, transportation, health services: these are things that everyone needs and uses, so the idea is that everyone pays into them and everyone can use them fairly.... but Doctors still get paid more than chocolate tasters, so there's a reason to aspire to "better" or harder jobs, or to work at jobs which take more effort or are less pleasant but give more financial rewards. You can still gain personally *as well as* sharing services with others. This is generally more appealing and is *fairer* if not *more equal*. The NHS (British National Health Service) is a great example of socialism "working" - everyone pays in with their taxes, and everyone can use the NHS for free. You pay in a little more if you earn more, but you are still allowed to earn more (ie a Doctor isn't told he has to be paid the same as a street cleaner) Capitalism - Capitalism doesn't necessarily "work" any better than Socialism or Communism... it just happens to be that Capitalism works in favour of people who already have power/money, so the people with power/money work to keep it that way. The "true" answer is probably somewhere closer to Norway/Sweden/Denmark, where people are able to earn more money and free markets work for "commodities" (eg luxuries), but "services" are more tightly controlled and shared.
A medication I know of has possible side effects of nausea, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal ulceration/bleeding, raised liver enzymes, diarrhea, constipation, epistaxis, headache, dizziness, priapism, rash, salt and fluid retention, hypertension, esophageal ulceration, **heart failure**, hyperkalemia, renal impairment, confusion, bronchospasm. What is this horrible, deadly drug, you ask? Ibuprofen. Also known as Advil. Point being, nearly all drugs have the *potential* for harmful side effects. It's important to also be aware of the frequency of those side effects. A capable doctor can assess the risk of the side effects occurring and monitor the patient over time to continue updating that risk assessment. To be sure, Accutane may have a higher risk than some other drugs, but as others have pointed out, it's sometimes the only thing that works. It's all about the cost-benefit analysis - the likelihood and severity of the side effects weighed against what happens if you don't take the medication.
I'm assuming you're asking something like: Why does a 3TB drive cost more than a 2TB drive and the answer is yes, there are material costs involved. First take into consideration what a hard drive is made of: * Enclosure (the casing) * Controller (that green thingy on the bottom) * Drive Platters (basically shiny discs that actually store your data) * Drive Head  &  Etc (How the drive is read) The enclosure and drive head are pretty unimportant in this argument since they rarely change between drive types. What increases the cost is usually in the controller and the drive platters. Let's start with platters. Each platter has a certain physical capacity. Say for example you can fit 1GB of data onto a platter -- It would take 1000 of these to be able to store 1TB -- there's no physical way you could fit 1000 of these into a hard drive (which has certain height, length, width restrictions). So, you'll need to engineer some way to fit more space on a platter. You spend $$$ on research and development and finally (years later) you figure out how to get a whopping 250GB per platter. Now you can take 4 of these put them together to get 1TB. But ... you just spent a fortune figuring out how to store more data on these platters. So how do you recoup your costs? Make the price higher -- the high price reflects the huge investment made in figuring out how to make the drive in the first place. This is also why the price decreases as times goes by. The technology is mostly established for that drive, there's no more costs involved other than production (and occasional maintenance). Now, on to the controller. The controller, as the name might imply, controls how the data is read or written to the drive; it's the interface for your computer to talk to a hard drive. Imagine you spend very little on making a controller. All it does is blindly read and write data -- there's no error checking. So if by some weird mishap data becomes corrupt, it won't bother telling you or even noticing. Sounds like a pretty shitty drive, right? Well, that's why a lot of work goes into making more robust controllers that are catered to the drive. A specific hard drive model will probably have a completely custom controller that cannot be swapped with the controller for a different hard drive model. And this, again, goes back to the R & D in making said controller. After those factors, there's also supply and demand to take into consideration. Spinny drives on the smaller side have a smaller amount of demand, so supply is usually limited which drives the price up a bit. So the price per GB is usually higher than larger sized drives.
Tide has the best name recognition and a large market share. It is one of the top three brands with solid brand loyalty (people only want to use that brand and not other brands). Because of this Tide costs more for stores to buy compared to other brands. At the same time they can charge more for it because customers are willing to pay more. Stores want to pay as little as they can for Tide so they can keep more of the money they get for selling it. Some of these stores are willing to buy Tide from shady sources because it costs less than buying it from the manufacturer. This way the store pays as little as possible for the Tide and can sell it for the normal price. As long as the store doesn't care where the Tide came from, criminals can sell Tide to the store. Tide is such a popular and widespread product that they can steal it from just about anywhere. TL:DR: people want Tide, stores want to pay as little as possible for Tide, thieves steal Tide and sell to stores for less than distributor source:  URL_0 
Your neck has a lot of muscles in it to help support your head. When you're sitting up straight all of these muscles work together how they are supposed to to keep your head balanced. When you sleep in a way for a long period of time with your head in a position it is not used to your muscles dont like that. You're over stretching and working some muscles while others are no longer stretching or working at all. The muscles that are over worked from stretching too much can get sore when you wake up. They've had to do all sorts of the extra work trying to compensate for your head being in an odd position and using only some of your muscles to support it. edited for spelling
Most weird terms are explained similar to this:  > The word corn derives from Old English, and is used to describe any small, hard particles or grains The meaning of the word changed over time. Your gran used to have lots of gay moments when she was a child, and she would have proudly told anyone and nobody would have found that strange. Nowadays, "gay" can still be "happy", but it usually is a different kind of happy. This is similar to the old English word "apple", which used to refer to any fruit:  >  Old English æppel "apple; any kind of fruit; fruit in general,"  URL_0

Back in the day, dentistry wasn't a medical profession. Dentists weren't doctors with degrees who went to school for 6 years and then apprenticed for another 6. Dentists were your local barber or blacksmith. Basically anyone who had the tools to pull a tooth from your head. Because of that 'tradition', dentistry is a completely separate medical profession from everything else. A dentist is a D.D.S -- a medical doctor (cardiologist, dermatologist, endocrinologist, GP) is an M.D. All of that carries over to insurance. On a side note there are free health care system that include dentistry, like for example the health care system of Poland, where a visit to the dentist is covered under the free national health care. In simplest terms it's insurance companies, capitalising on the traditional split of medicine and dentistry to find an excuse not to cover dental needs under a general health care plan so they can bill you for it separately.
Maybe because you rarely reflect and you also happen to reflect at night as the day has ended and you can start thinking about life and what not.
Part of the healing process is removing any potential pathogens that may have gotten into the wound, so there is an inflammatory response at the site of injury. More blood flows to the area and more white blood cells are recruited to kill stuff, and in the process release different chemicals that cause you to be itchy, like histamine.
Social media/media has made it appear there are assholes everywhere, when it's just that assholes are the most vocal. The majority of us, I would imagine, would seem pretty normal to you.
Your testicles are connected to your stomach region via nerves and blood vessels. The pain that you feel on initial impact travels up to that area (and later to your spine) via the spermatic plexus (big bunch of connected nerves), which is the primary nerve in each of your testicles. Because your testicles are encased in a saggy sack with no muscular or bone structure to defend them, being hit in the balls hurts a lot more than being hit on other parts of your body because it's hitting the nerves. If you snap the elastic onto your arm, there is muscle and bone in the way to protect your nerves. There is nothing to defend the nerves and so it hurts a lot more when you get hit in the nuts.
Vitamins are required for health, but that doesn't imply that 'more vitamins equals a better outcome'. If you packed as much as possible into all processed foods, what you'd end up with is people suffering from toxic doses. In the case of some of these (like vitamin A), that is extremely serious, or even fatal.
The major contributing factor is your circadian rhythm. This rhythm is basically your natural biological clock. However it does not run exactly on a 24 hr cycle, there are slight deviations naturally and other factors can contribute to altering your biological clock. The next factor to take into account is which stage of the sleep cycle you are waking up from. There are typically 5 stages of sleep, stage 1/2 are "active" sleep cycles, your brain activity is still highly active and almost indistinguishable from a wake person. In stage 1/2, you are also more likely to respond to stimuli, such as someone calling your name. Stage 3 is regarded as "inactive" sleep cycle, this is the stage where your brain activity drastically drops, preparing your brain and body to enter stage 4. In stage 3, a person is much harder to wake up and waking from this stage leaves a person exhausted and generally disorientated. Stage 4 sleep is where actual rest and rejuvenation occurs. In this stage, your brain activity is picking up slightly but still in a mild manner, not too much to be called wakefullness, but enough to signal repairs in the body. Lastly is REM stage, this is where your brain is now increasing activity and causing dreams. After REM, the cycle repeats back from stage 1. Basically as you sleep, you go through this 1-4+rem cycle over and over, with each cycle lasting about 90 mins. Depending on what your body needs, stage1/2 will shorten as you go through the sleep cycles and lengthen stage 4 for rest and recovery or REM sleep. If you wake from REM, you will feel refreshed and ready, that is why most people dont remember dreams or recall a dream suddenly disrupted by waking up. If you wake up during stage 3/4, you will feel tired and exhausted, your brain was trying to turn down the power after all, and signal the body to recover from things like exhaustion or injuries. So thats it, a bit long for ELI5, but its a complicated question that takes many things into account, as is common when talking about neurological issues Edit: forgot to talk about sleep deficit and how that also contributes alot, but im on mobile and cant continue forever.
Chronic Lyme disease is kind of the flavor of the month for a certain type of personality disorder. There's no evidence it exists, and since it doesn't exist it's impossible to prove someone doesn't have it. And since it's impossible to prove someone doesn;t have it people who wish to believe they have it can never be dissuaded.
It really depends. There are several types of headaches: tension, cluster, migraine, and some others that are much more rare. ELI5, round one for the major causes: Little pipes full of blood pump that blood to your brain. Sometimes the pipes get too big, which causes little pain wires to get excited. This hurts. (ELI20: vasodilation causes stimulation of the nociceptors, which your brain interprets as pain.) ELI5, round two: sometimes we tense our muscles too much, which causes the same pain wires to fire. This hurts. (ELI20: tension headaches can be caused by muscle tension, often secondary to stress. Eliminate the tension or stress, or both, and the pain should subside. One way to do this is to flex the muscle that is causing the pain- often the trapezoids- shrug your shoulders to your ears until the muscles are very tense, then allow them to fall limp.) ELI5, round three: Sometimes our bodies suck. Your head can get ouchy because of this. (ELI20: genetics can predispose us to migraines. This is unfortunate, and we should try to avoid any "triggers." Triggers are usually things like caffeine, coffee, chocolate, etc.) NB: If you want to know more, I suggest reading [this section]( URL_0 ) of the wikipedia entry for headaches. It has a lot of information, but what you should try to key in on is the type, location, and duration of the pain. This can help you when you talk to your primary care provider about fixing the problem. Hope you feel better! :)
I'm going to avoid discussing service industries, because they are drastically different and less subject to the global market (You can't work construction in Detroit and Munich on the same day) I'm mostly talking tech. The biggest driver of disparity in tech jobs is cost of living. If it costs 2000 a month to live in Boston, and 200 a month to live in India, then salaries will reflect that. Companies aren't in the business of lowering profits to give employees extra spending money.
There was a study that made headlines indicating some low ABV beers might be better than water, but it was never published and doesn't appear to have been repeatable. However, this summary of later studies [seems to indicate]( URL_0 ) that beer with less than 2% alcohol (essentially 1 Bud/Coors or similar and 2 cans of water or the ultra light styles) hydrates about as well as water.
You're comparing a tiny antenna in a tiny phone running off a tiny battery to something with all the space and power it could ever want. The reception is just plain better to start with. Don't forget, the autonomous system is far more than just GPS. Speed sensors keep tracking even if signal is lost (like many modern cars now have). Even if a GPS fix is lost, if you have the last position and an accurate log of distance and direction traveled, it's not hard to figure out where you are now. Cameras and radar (and LIDAR-thanks /u/PangoriaFallstar) are constantly checking around you to react to the real-life traffic and pedestrians that GPS can't help with. GPS isn't what keeps it in a lane or on a road, it's the various sensors. GPS is mostly used for location/routing. EDIT: For those looking for more, check out this [article/video]( URL_0 ), which goes very deep into how the system works on a technical level, and even shows a great visualization of what the car "sees". They also mention how these systems compensate for GPS drop outs.
The thinking behind this is in the evening or at night its generally cooler. And without bright sunlight, with cooler temperatures, less of the water you spray onto your lawn will evaporate.
One thing people haven't mentioned is immigration. Despite claims otherwise, immigration was one of the main reasons for the UK voting to leave the EU. Countries in the EU have to let people from other EU countries live and work there with no restrictions. This has resulted in a large number of people coming from less wealthy countries such as Poland coming to live in the wealthier ones including the UK. Some people don't like this because they think these immigrants will take advantage of the benefit system and not contribute to society. Although this is statistically not true in the average case. Other people don't like this because they feel they are taking jobs that British people could have done instead, leading to greater unemployment. However now many British businesses and organisations are likely to face a shortage of workers. And finally some people don't like how society has changed due to immigration. There are many more non-English speakers than there used to be, and there are lots of shops around catering to various immigrant groups. This makes some people feel like it's "not their country any more".
Because of the "expected" economic revenue said Stadium will bring to a city and surrounding areas. In most cases, it pays off, although the question is always going to be: "Why is a person worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars not paying for their own stadium?" of which the answer would be "Because they don't have to when there are cities around the country that will fight to have the team in their city and be willing to pay for a large amount of the funding."
The Republican party would certainly not benefit from the move. Their target demographics tend to be wealthier, older, or both. In other words, people who do not especially need a national holiday to get off work, or who can afford to take a day off. Furthermore, it would allow the middle to lower class demographics more opportunities to vote, which on average would favor democrats, not republicans. The Democrats could also potentially be harmed by such a move by admittedly more nebulous reasons. The largest one would be that the poor generally do want to work so that they can make more money for their day to day needs. Mandating a day off would negatively impact a large voting block for the democratic party, possibly driving their supporters away. EDIT: Rather than responding to everyone, I'll just address some common complaints here: 1. I know it's illegal to prevent your employee from voting. That doesn't mean you have to pay them for the time they missed, which provides an economic incentive to stay at work. 2. I also know that not every rich person votes Republican and every poor person Democrat. These are general demographic trends among major voting blocks in each party. Enough people do fit in these categories that it becomes useful to examine how changing policies would impact these demographics. 3. In the US, you do not have to pay your employees on voting day or national holidays. Some people do, but it is by no means required. 4. The weekend has been suggested multiple times. I do not know what impact this would have. That's all I really have to say on the matter.
Mike from SongMeanings here. Our lyrics are licensed, but the majority of them are lyrics derived from a few content editors. From my probing the industry, the copyright makes getting the actual lyrics difficult -- often there are several writers to a song, all represented by different publishers and all with different lyrics too.

Much of Europe has natural levels of fluoride high enough to net the benefits of fluoridation. Many regions of the US do not.
Astrology as a 'science' is complete bunk. It has no basis whatosever in solid science fields like statistics. There's actually **no** science behind it, not even junk science. But astrology AS A BUSINESS, where it's all about making money works, largely by offering some "wish fulfilment", and that part has a basis in science fields like behavioural psychology. Most people wish to know more about their future. Many of them want to believe there's something out there that can help them know that future, and some of them are gullible and have money to spend. Astrology fits nicely in here. There's also a little entertainment value in it for some. Astrology can provide some minor amusement and distraction for folks as well. So there's customers out there for astrology despite it being complete bunk. And that's why there's still astrology columns in a lot of lower-quality newspapers out there.
Terminal velocity is reached when gravity can no longer pull you any faster through the earths atmosphere, for humans this is about 175MPH But Felix jumped from so high up the air was much much thinner (so thin he was using a space suit to breath) the result was much less air to slow him down and thus he was able to reach speeds over 700MPH
"Civilization" is a bit of a strong word. AFAWK, they do not create art. They do not recount epic legends. They are able to build colonies by use of pheromones. They recognize the behavior they should have in certain areas by chemical trails. Foraging ants know to bring extra back to the hive. nursing ants know to tend to the queen. The queen knows to give birth once it has sufficient food. They know when it is safe to leave their hole when it is warm enough outside for them (They use body heat and heat of decomposing waste to stay warm in colder situations). They don't need large brains. Every ant has hard wired, instinctual roles. Narrow in scope, there is little need for a larger brain. They overcome difficult challenges not by out thinking them (a common tactic of primates) but instead by throwing more brood at the problem. With the high rate of egg laying done by queens, this is a much more economic solution to the problem.
Their 'sweet spot' is basically equivalent to a human's ticklish area. When you scratch let's say an area of your dog's tummy and starts twitching/kicking, the dog is just trying to scratch the sweet spot.
 >  Curious how hd tv is easily sent over the air but hd video streaming online takes high bandwidth and a good internet connection. A television broadcast is like talking into a loudspeaker system to address an entire stadium. Video streaming online is like holding an individual conversation with every person in the stadium simultaneously.
It is one approach that has been suggested. There are a few reasons that a "progressive tax" where the rich pay more is fairly common: Savings. Rich people tend to save more of their money and spend less of it (since the poor need to spend all of it to survive today). With a tax just on consumption (like a sales tax) this actually means that the rich pay less tax than the poor. Sheltering. Rich people have more flexibility about how they earn money. They can get shares in a company in another country rather than a salary, so they can avoid paying tax on some of their income. Again this means the poor end up paying more tax. If all of the loopholes were closed this wouldn't be as much of a problem, but that's difficult to do when someone is willing to spend $1M to find ways around the tax laws. Efficiency. Why a percentage of income. If taxes are to provide services, why shouldn't everyone just pay an equal share (e.g. $10,000/yr)? If we do that, then taxes are limited to what lowest earning workers can afford to pay, which is pretty close to nothing. If I earn 10x what my husband does, and we insist we always split the costs, then I end up living and eating very cheaply, but if I contribute more then we both end up with a better house, car, and food. Happiness. $1,000 means more to someone making $10,000/yr than it does to someone making $100,000/yr. It's one thing to not be able to buy a new iPhone, but it's another to not be able to buy food. Starving leads to desperate acts like crime, or armed revolution, which ultimately make the rich unhappy also. Having the rich contribute more leads to an overall happier society. Fairness. There is an idea, particularly in the US, but also in the UK, that people are morally entitled to their income, because being rich is a reflection of pure skill. However, in reality almost everyone’s income results largely from factors beyond their control -- what country you're born in, the quality of schools, the road, water, sewer, and healthcare infrastructure, the legal and regulatory enforcement system, and their parent's income. Imagine being born in Tasmania 1,000 years ago, vs Rome 2,000 years ago, vs India today. Some of being rich is about hard work, but most of it is about luck. From a moral point of view, the rich aren't really entitled to all of that money, so society can fairly ask the wealthy to pay more. By having the rich pay more the society can improve and be happier. However, the society also wants to encourage hard work, so there needs to be some incentive to work hard and be productive so we can't make the tax rate so progressive that the rich lose all of their money. Ultimately even with the progressive taxes, there are enough advantages to already being rich that the rich are making more money much faster than the poor (or even the average), so the existing tax rates probably aren't progressive enough.
From Wikipedia "Nocturnal penile tumescence (abbreviated as NPT), also known colloquially as morning wood, is a spontaneous erection of the penis during sleep or when waking up. All men without physiological erectile dysfunction experience nocturnal penile tumescence, usually three to five times during the night, typically during REM sleep.[1] NPTs are believed to contribute to penile health.[2]" I seem to recall the spongy tissues of the penis can develop scar tissue if blood flow is suboptimal in a flaccid penis for 24 hours. Your body is performing routine maintenance to keep it in working order.
It's not purely arbitrary. There's a logic behind it. First off there's the brackets, this has to be first because this is how you force an equation to do what you want and override the other rules,if it was after then you'd lose the ability to do something. Next is exponentiation, multiplication and division. This group of three are all united under the banner of product actions. Things that multiply and divide. The order actually doesn't matter for multiplication and division. After that there's addition and subtraction. Again the order of addition/subtraction doesn't matter. So we'll put them under the banner of sums. So why are products given priority over sums? This is one of those things that mathematicians the world over and throughout history have sort of silently agreed with one another. The best suspicion is that all products of sums can be rewritten as the sum of products. EG: you can write (A+3) x (B+5) as (AxB)+(3xB)+(Ax5)+(Bx5), but notice how many more brackets are in the second one. If you made sums have precedence over products, you could write (A+3) x (B+5) as A+3 x B+3, but then you have to write (AxB)+(3xB)+(Ax5)+(Bx5) once you expanded it out. Now if you put products before sums (A+3) x (B+5) stays the same but (AxB)+(3xB)+(Ax5)+(Bx5) becomes AB+3B+5A+5B, it's so obvious you don't even need the 'x' symbol anymore and you save time writing parenthesis. So why exponentiation before multiplication? Similar book keeping reasons. Exponentiation is basically A^2 = AxA. And the product of sums for (A+1) x (2A+1) = 2(A^2 )+(2xA)+(Ax1)+(1x1). But the situations where you want to multiply before exponentiating come up less frequently then quadratic equations and such, at least to early mathematicians, so they just save the brackets and write 2A^2 +2A+A+1 #TL:DR math people are kinda lazy/efficient, they came up with this because it takes less time to write it down that way.
A conventional oven that heats up everything inside an oven including air, the oven sides, etc. That's quite a waste of heat but if you put one or two hot pockets in the oven, you won't see much of a difference. A microwave oven is much more efficient, which is why it's fast. It only sends energy to food you put in it. Its energy output is limited though, so the more food you put in it, the less energy each part is getting.
Lobsters spoil extremely quickly once dead. So they need to be kept alive until just before you cook them. Most actually kill them with a knife prior to boiling, but the "traditional" method is to just put them in a pot and cook them alive.
Altitude has nothing to do with it. Acceleration is what produces that feeling. What a sudden drastic change in altitude produces is an intense pain in your ears. When you are quickly accelerated towards your feet you experience that butterflies sensation. When you're accelerated towards your head you feel like you're being squashed. It's just the way your squishy bits react
Hairlessness allows us to regulate our body heat more easily. One of the main advantages humans have over other animals is our ability to run long distances, and hunt animals by tiring them out. If we were covered in fur, we would simply heat up too quickly and not be able to run for long.
Imagine you live near a lake. Your town gets water from this lake and has done since it was founded, in fact, that's why the town was built there, because building your town somewhere without water is really really stupid. One day a rich guy buys your towns lake. Now it's HIS water and he says that you can't have any unless you pay him. You're poor, your whole town is poor, hell your whole country is, that's why some dick was willing to sell your lake, it makes them rich and they don't care what happens to you. Now normally a company would have to price for its market and lower the price so you can buy their product. But the guy who bought your lake doesn't actually want to sell it to you. He's putting it in bottles and selling it to people on the other side of the world. People who don't even need it, because they can get as much water as they like from the tap in their kitchen. I think you'd agree that the guy who bought your lake is a bad person.
I got this. One I think you are mistaken it is actually a crisping sleeve. The ones that are different are between the croissant crust and the deli crust or what ever other crust there is. The croissant crust is taller (because croissants rise differently) so requires a different size crisping sleeve. Source- I may or may not have worked on this business. Edit- fixed typo
It's not so much "inhumane" as "gruesome". The huge rush of blood is very messy. While the state might want someone dead, it's not going to want the optics of desecrating a person's body this way.
In the US, people hear horror stories of 6-month waits to see a doctor, and the inability to get certain procedures done at all in some cases, and little or no choice in what type of care you receive. Of course, lots of folks are already on Medicare and Medicaid in this country, so to be reflexively against what one might consider to be "socialized medicine" is kind of curious...
Protecting your border gets much harder when you're not entirely sure where that border is on the ground. Keeping the border clear is a good way to maintain that distinction.
They do really sell for those prices, but each bid is a penny over the last one (hence penny auctions) and you have to pay for bids. For example, you might buy 100 bids for $60, and then you use those bids to bump the price by one penny. If you happen to bump it the final amount, you can buy that $20 TV or whatever it ended up as, but you've also paid (# of bids * $0.60) for your bidding. And keep in mind that they're getting (# of bids * $0.60) from *everyone* bidding on that item, so if something starts at $1 and sells at $9, they've actually cleared $480 on that item.
Porn is often over-acted and therefore a little unrealistic. Porn is going for raw arousal from its target audience. Movies on the other hand typically go for as realistic of a portrayal as possible (without showing actual penetration like porn), and the point is often to get a character's emotions across to the audience. Basically, porn is about arousal, movie sex is about emotion. EDIT: oh, and movie stars typically have a lot more training in acting ;)
This is only part of the story, but Upstate Vermont and New Hampshire used to be fairly densely settled with scattered small farms tilling the rocky soil. As the American West opened up however, people realized that there was much better land to be had elsewhere. Many of these people moved away. Once the farmers left, there wasn'ta lot to replace the local economies. Not a lot of mineral resources, no large navigable rivers, not a lot of major trading centers As a result, people did not return to the areas they moved out of. Vermont used to be 85% farmland, 15% forest. Now the opposite is true. If you go through a lot of forest in Vermont you'll find old stone walls all over the place from abandoned farms.
I work in a bank and I hand them out randomly in cash back. People like them. Especially old men and kids.
EDIT: Done Socialism is the social/democratic ownership of the means of production. It's considered bad because socialism took over a third of the world and was the biggest threat to the American way of life since Nazi Germany, and even then that was a European war. The rallying against socialism movement started when the US put the CPUS (Communist Party of the United States) on trial, and arrested them due to fears of an American Bolshevik revolution which would topple the capitalist system.  URL_0  This event destroyed socialist leadership. It was very public and served as a warning to ALL socialists in America. This is the origin of socialism's lack of precedence in the US and its hatred. Socialism is no longer practiced by any countries except Cuba. Europe is not socialist, but a Social Democracy. Now, I want to explain what the definition of socialism means, and I am a socialist and have been for a few years now. Social/Democratic ownership. This means that society as a whole has ownership, and society can democratically control whatever they own. Think of a table of kindergarteners and they have a box of crayons in the middle. This type of ownership would look like 5 of the kids voting that they use yellow to color the sun, while 3 kids vote for the sun to be colored green. Because 5 > 3, they color the sun yellow. This is opposed to capitalism's private ownership, where instead of society as a whole having ownership, it is one person or a group of people. Next, means of production, the thing that society is owning. Means of production means any facility, resource, or tool that can create a physical and tangible product. Factories, assemblies, oil, uranium, trees, maybe even basic tools like a hammer and nails. (though sometimes the tools are considered too insignificant to qualify) Under socialism, personal property still exists. Family photos, heirlooms, personal belongings, and cars are things you can still privately own because they are NOT means of production. Money does not count as a means of production because it does not directly create a physical or tangible product. Rather, it is used as a medium to exchange for products created by the means of production. Ok, so thats the definition. Next I am going to talk a bit about the different types of socialism. Left Libertarianism: Anarchism and socialist minarchism. Contrary to popular belief, anarchism denotes a socialist economy unless specifically stated to be anarcho-capitalist. These socialist ideologies actually make up the most of the socialist community right now. Most socialists are libertarian socialists. Democratic Socialism: A type of socialism where a representative democracy like what all western civilizations have now is used alongside a socialist economy. Contrary to another popular belief, Europe is not democratic socialist, and one of the more famous examples of this was the Paris Commune. Market Socialism: I'm not a market socialist and I'm not too clear what the exact mechanics are here, but socialism does not always mean planned economy. This ideology wants socialism AND free market to coexist. Market socialists, feel free to expand on this. Marxist Socialism: I don't really want to call this a well fleshed out ideology, because Marxism was a critique of capitalism, not really an ideology of socialism in itself. However, Karl Marx did vaguely go over his idea of socialism.  > Karl Marx had said in his works that socialism is ONLY possible if the transitioning country is INDUSTRIALIZED and DEVELOPED.  > His thought process on how society would transition was something like this:  > **PreCap(feudalism?)** **- > **  > **Capitalism(industrialization/developing)** **- > **  > **Proletarian Revolution** **- > **  > **Socialist state** **- > **  > **Abolishment of state(communism)** Leninist Socialism/all derivatives(Marxist Leninism, Maoism, etc)/Communism: BEFORE I explain this, I must first note something that even socialists get wrong. The word 'communism' is a capitonym. This means that its definition changes based on capitalization. 'C'ommunism is what I will be talking about right here. It refers to Leninist states or states with a vanguard/Communist Party. 'c'ommunism on the otherhand, means stateless, classless, moneyless society. It is the end goal of most socialist ideologies, including the one I am going to talk about here. So, Leninism/Communism is when the 'best of the best' of the workers take control of the government and establish a Communist or Vanguard Party, which should mean a technocracy because the government is controlled by the workers, but this elite group in the government, the state, owns everything as opposed to society. This is justified by saying that the technocratic government is representing the interests of society, so it is social and democratic ownership by an extension. Unlike Marx's idea of socialism where socialism can only be achieved in a developed capitalist state, Leninism was practiced ONLY in undeveloped, newly capitalist or precapitalist states. Lenin seemed fine with this, but he agreed with Marx that the best place for revolution was in a developed country. (which at the time of the early 1900's was Germany) Additionally, when the 'conditions' are 'right' (world socialism has been achieved) the state 'withers away' and the end goal of 'c'ommunism is achieved. In Leninism, there is supposed to be a counteracting 'checks and balances' system called the soviet councils. These are councils across the country made up of workers. Just like how in the US the courts scale all the way to the Supreme court, the councils scale all the way to the Supreme Soviet. This was supposed to exist to counteract the power of the Communist Party. When Stalin came along, he consolidated his power by stripping many of the capabilities of the soviets, including the Supreme Soviet, so that the checks and balances was weak to nonexistent. Next, Social Democracy: Social Democracy technically means 2 different things. It originally meant socialist reformism: the idea that socialism can be attained through reforming of the current system. Social Democracy calls for the reform of our system to democratic socialism. This was unpopular at that time (1800-early 1900's) as most socialists were revolutionaries and believed that the only way for socialism to exist is through a revolution. (democratic socialism was still popular, but most supporters were revolutionaries) Now? Social democracy means a powerful welfare state and a government that actively looks after their citizens. Progressive taxes, free healthcare and education, some state ownership, all hallmarks of a social democracy. This definition of social democracy is NOT socialist, nor does it actually want to be socialist. I'm not going to talk about how socialism could be good or bad for Americans, or how if it works well with other countries, because it seems to boil to opinion and semantics on what 'works well' and 'good and bad' means. If someone wants to share their opinion, yeah go ahead, but OP you will always get a different response. I will finish this off with a real ELI5 example to help understand socialism:
A prolific SF writer named L. Ron Hubbard reportedly said to some colleagues one time "The real way to get rich is to start your own religion." He later wrote a book called "Dianetics" which gave people advice about how their own BS was holding them back from success in life. It was mostly stuff he made up, but the book became a best seller. The book became the basis of the teachings of the Church of Scientology, which Hubbard founded. (He later claimed that Dianetics was revealed to him when he died in a dentist's chair and then came back to life.) People have many, many issues with Scientology. It isn't really much like most other religions, and a lot of people believe that its status as a religion is just a tax dodge. (Including the German government.) You have to pay to get in, and have to continue to pay over time. As you go up in levels and learn more of the core teachings, you get to some stuff that isn't just New Age psychobabble, it's certifiably crazy. (Of course, you have to invest a lot of time and money to even get to the point of those being revealed to you.) If you really want to learn more, google "Xenu" or "Thetans". There's a fairly recent book called "Going Clear" by Lawrence Wright that goes through all this, if you are interested. I've heard some interviews with the author, and he's done his homework. It's actually quite interesting, in a slightly sad sort of way. Hubbard was a complicated guy...talented and perceptive, but deeply insecure and more than a little nutty. Some of his SF is pretty decent. It can be hard to find good information about the CoS on-line because in the past they have been very vigorous about attacking anyone who said anything negative about the church, although it's gotten a lot easier in the last few years. And as /u/Infohiker correctly points out, they seem to try very hard to control everyone in the group and information about their teachings. If you create a website about Scientology, they will probably eventually attack you. But with so much social media these days I think they've had a hard time applying pressure on-line like they used to. **TL;DR** - It's mostly crazy bullshit, but *profitable* crazy bullshit.
Child care provider/hopeful future postpartum doula here. When babies/toddlers are overtired, their bodies produce cortisol to help them stay awake. This stress inhibits sleep and results in the hormonal/emotional mess you speak of. Edit: I've learned that what I thought was right is not accurate. My information comes from baby sleep specialist sites like  URL_0  and I haven't found backing from sources with more authority. I never bothered to check for myself because the explanation made sense to me and aligned with my experiences. Sorry, guys!
Day 1: Taiwan falls to china. Japan announces a plan for a nuclear weapons program in a last ditch effort to deter chinese aggression. North Korea invades South Korea. China denies bankrolling and supplying NK but everyone knows better. Day 4: Israel announces an easing of restrictions on Palestinian citizens. They offer a legitimate plan for a Palestinian state in an attempt to hold off Arab aggression. It fails. Day 7: Russia retakes portions of Eastern Europe. Economic sanctions be damned. EU nations begin considering development of nukes and a return to conscription. Day 10: Republicans take credit for huge budget surplus. Day 11: unemployment spikes after soldiers become unemployed, democrats announce a return if FDR style make work projects for young men. Day 30: China continues to expand into SE Asia. Day 45: Putin is assassinated. Day 1009: Two hairdressers crawl out of a destroyed subway station. They admire a 6 eyes cat before clubbing it to death and eating it.
We have a multinational military coalition that include various nations who are launching airstrikes at ISIS and supplying/training their opposition.
The first time I remember hearing it was on South Park years ago (Cartman). Not sure if they made it up on the show, or if they were referencing something else.
The gas is not what makes the heat. The heat comes from an electric arc, and the inert gas (argon, I think) provides shielding to keep the air away. If air got in there while the metal was molten, it would oxidize very badly.
She was actually born with both sight and hearing, but lost it to disease at 19 months. She learned via touch and by having the words for various things spelled into her palm. She learned to speak by feeling peoples lips as they talked.
When you panic you do one of several things. Freeze, Fight, or Run. If you are out in the woods, and you see a large predator and you freeze. You are less noticeable, less threatening if it does see you, and you aren't provoking it into chasing you by running, so other members of the herd that run get noticed, and chased down first. or you fight, and with the adrenaline you may buy yourself time to run, or for others to assist you, or you may even ward of the predator by being too tough for it to be worth it. Or you run, and the adrenaline makes you fast enough that you aren't caught(or faster than the slowest of the herd) I know when I'm hunting deer and it hasn't snowed, if they freeze and are far enough away I won't even notice them. They blend in so well that I typically just watch for movement because every dark bush looks like a deer from a distance to my eyes until I scope it out or see movement. For people who freeze, and never unfreeze, evolutionary anomaly, they would get weeded out. If things go south they should turn to run or fight. EDIT: To add, in modern society it isn't very useful because you are typically freezing in situations when you need to perform some task or move out of the way of something, when historically you just need to not be noticed or run away.
Birds have an organ called the Uropygial gland, which is an excretory gland that produces oil for their feathers. Birds will use their beaks to spread this oil over their feathers. One benefit of this oil is that it makes the feathers waterproof.
Put in a very simple way: Fat does not clog arteries by itself, fat deposits on blood vessel walls as a protective measure, against damaged caused to the lining by other things, mainly, sugar. its a protective measure to prevent further damage to the vessels, and to the blood constituents, the issue is that damage accumulates and so does fat unless lifestyle is changed. In the early 20th century when people saw clotted arteries with fat, calcium etc, they erroneously assumed that those dietary elements were the factor that was causing the issue, without realising that they were blaming the defensive measure for the problem. Sadly medicine is this giant machine that takes ages to acknowledge information is inaccurate, and even longer to start changing how it deals with it, it takes decades. And analogy: They saw a huge traffic jam, they saw shinny lights (cops) and blamed the cops for the jam, instead of realising the cops are there because there was a car crash, which is the true factor to blame for the jam. Ketogenic and vegetarian diets are good to help reduce and even reverse those issues, because you are removing the factors that cause damage to the inner lining of the blood vessels (excess sugar), also helps with diabetes as you prevent constant insulin spikes which lead to insensitivity. Fats are needed by the body, and quite healthy in themselves, yes, even saturated which is quite important for you, the issue is also how much you eat. TL:DR: Sugars be the evil, not fat, fat just cool dudes helping you and getting all the blame.
I have only watched Musk's presentation, so there might be details elsewhere that I have missed. The main purpose of the shingles is aesthetics. These solar shingles are designed to look like regular house shingles. This starts serving the community who had the money and desire for solar power but did not want the big ugly panels. Unless there is an efficiency edge (I don't think so) or a decreased cost edge (He kept saying they were a similar price of a regular roof, but I have no numbers to back up this claim) the only thing these new shingles do is aesthetics. Powerwall is a newer technology that is supposed to solve the problem of uneven use and generation. Solar panels only make energy during the day, but people still use energy at night. Powerwall is just a giant battery that will store your solar power made in the day, and let you use it at night. Again, batteries are not new, but the affordability of giant batteries is a new thing. Also note, he specifically says that he does not intend for this kind of technology to replace utilities. He says if we get off gas heating and gas cars, we will triple the amount of electricity we need. That means we need to increase production by three times of what we currently do.
As far as I know, there isn't any mechanism to prevent this, but with how ridiculously unlikely it is to happen (and then even more unlikely you'd ever find out even if it did happen) I don't think it's something to be worth worrying about. Sure it's creepy to think about but even in the extreme off chance this couple then actually settled down and had kids completely unaware of their relation, I don't think notable genetic issues arise after just one generation. The sheer unlikeliness of any issue ever arising like this makes it not worth the effort trying to prevent imo. Maybe just don't sleep with people half your age who kinda look like you
Not at all. OJ has a lot of sugar and acids that can harm your teeth. It also has about as much calories as coke. But it also has vitamins (espcially freshly squeezed juice). Just do not drink too much of it and regularly brush your teeth. Coke, on the other hand is coloured with caramel color, which is quite unhealthy. Coke also contains phosphoric acid instead of citric acid because it is cheaper. The high sugar content and the phosphoric acid are both suspected of making, especially children, nervous and twitchy. Your conclusion should be: Too much of any of those beverages are unhealthy. Sodas much more so. So don't drink too much of them. Fruit juices in _moderation_ are healthy, though. Edit: Wow, this exploded into my most valuable post so far, karma-wise. I'll tell you where I got my info from: School. Many years ago in the mid-nineties. And you kno what? I still trust my old, long-retired chemistry teacher more on that subject, than any redditors here. I especially doubt the ability of redditors to judge the importance of papers on the subject, especially as I'm sure that not few of those papers are funded by the food industry. We are talking about an industry bigger than tobacco here, after all. And you know what kind of money _they_ poured into this kind of "PR" in decades gone. Edit 2: As I wrote below, I have the following suggestion: As an adult, drink as much OJ or soda as you wish. You are an adult after all. For children, in my opinion, a glass a week of soda is way too much. Give it only to them at birthday parties, fairs, etc. This way it will remain something special for them. And keep in mind: It is disputed here if soda is unhealthy. On the other hand, no one disputes that not drinking soda is definitely not unhealthy.
Well, first of all, there's tons. The most famous and amazing examples of ancient architecture were left by the African civilization we call 'Egyptians'. So, you say, okay, but they were Mediterranean. What about central Africa? Well, Mali is pretty central, and they left awesome looking stuff [like this]( URL_0 ) all over the place. Or did you mean from the southern parts of Africa? Because [Zimbabwe has awesome ruins too]( URL_1 ). A better question to ask is why we don't glorify the ancient African civilizations (other than Egypt) like we do the ancient mesoamerican ones. Both were wiped out largely by the Spanish and Portuguese, and both had their legacies wiped out by colonialism. In truth, I don't know the answer to that one. We just never did.

I believe the execution can be halted right up to the 'push' of the drug sequence into the IV. This means that the needle is placed a few minutes before the actual execution starts. So they still need to be able to abort the procedure at a moments notice with no harm to the prisoner. Edit: Grammar
Let's say that a species is being successful if it can continually create viable offspring and replace it's individual organisms at least as fast as they are dying. There's multiple paths to this in terms of reproductive strategies. One strategy, is to maximize the number of offspring, even if that reduces the chances of any particular individual surviving. An alternate strategy is a lower number of offspring, but taking more care to ensure their survival. Dogs are somewhere in the middle, while humans are basically at the far end of the "fewer offspring" side. And following those different paths through evolution has resulted in significant biological differences. The human brain is significantly more capable than a dog's, but it also needs much more time to fully develop to the point where you get a human being capable of self preservation and successful reproduction. A wolf (which dogs were bred from) is physically and mentally fit enough to reproduce and care for its offspring within a couple of years of its birth, can create a few litters of puppies, and then get old and die within a decade. Over that same 10 years, a human baby will still not even be developed enough to live on its own, much less create and care for a baby. If you assume about 15 years for a human to develop enough to be in a position to successfully create and care for a child, and then another 15 years for them to care for their child to the point where that child can be independent, then that's 30 years. And that's just for one kid. Before modern medicine came around, children died much more often, so the average mother might give birth to 5+ kids, so you're looking at being 35+ when your last child doesn't need you any longer. And 35 was a pretty typical life expectancy for much of the history of humanity.
Car parts aren't mass produced for outside retail. Computer parts are. Thats really why. Intel makes a ton of processors. It doesnt make a difference if you buy one or dell buys thousands. The processors the same. In This way you can get a similar deal to what they can and not have to deal with their markup for profit.
I belong to a reenactment group. We wear full wool uniforms all summer. It's really not that bad. It's better than getting sunburnt as sunblock didn't exist back then.
You want the real answer? It isn't fun. THEY DO. (At least a number of them do.) The reason they all test "STD-free" is because there's no reliable HPV (genital warts) test for men (as far as I know), and HSV-1/HSV-2 (oral / genital herpes) is so common (HSV-1 affects about 75-80% of the population, HSV-2 affects about 1 in 4 women and 1 in 5 men), that they don't include it on the standard STD screening. The standard STD screening mostly screens out those STDs that are fatal (HIV) or treatable (gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, etc., etc., etc.). Sorry to ruin the fantasy. (Those of you that are sexually active, when you get STD tested (and you should), you may want to ask for the HSV-1/HSV-2 tests to be included to make sure you're not a passive carrier, as something like 50% of people with HSV have no idea.)
Because this allows the spot to service more people. It doesn't matter if the spot is always full, it matters if that full spot was useful for one person or for ten.
Whole lot of misinformation here. If the victim can't see the executioner his ghost doesn't know who to haunt.
It depends on the person really. Some people will admit things and let us do our jobs. Other think they only need to outsmart their own lawyers and the issues will go away, because they think the prosecution and judge won't care for some reason. A lot of them spend much of the time trying to fool us or convince us, and get upset when we point out obvious flaws in their stories. Most people will tell a distorted version of the truth, which contains both admissions and twists to make it 'excusable'. Of course what they think is 'excusable' is often totally different to what the law thinks.
There is more than one type of slavery. In ancient Athens, conquered people became slaves, but their children were born free. They retired as free people, and it was really more like having your country invaded then being given a job you have to do. Others like the Romans would keep foreigners as slaves, and you could be born a slave. These slaves were invisible though to society - they belonged to a household and had to do the jobs they were given, but they had time off, sometimes got paid, they fell in love and got married and had families. You couldn't tell if someone walking up the street was a slave or not. These slaves are the ancestors of the European peasant, the common folks. It was only in about the 17th century or so that we got the idea that people should be allowed to say 'no' if their Lord told them to do something. The American South did not view Africans as human beings, but as animals. They broke up families, they engaged in forced breeding programs where men were beaten until they raped the woman they were told to breed with, they recklessly endangered slaves lives, they did not allow any sort of dignity. 'Chattel' slavery is the most powerfully dehumanizing form of slavery, and it only ever existed in the Caribbean and American South.
The first clocks were sun dials, and originally the duration of a day was divided into 12 equal segments by the Egyptians. These became hours, and obviously over time we discovered ways of counting the hours during night time as well. The Babylonians divided the hour in 60 minutes, but it took a long time before minutes could be accurately measured. In Medieval times in Europe a wide variety of mechanical devices were created that mimicked the sun dial (which is what decided which direction clockwise was). The mechanical clocks started to measure out minutes, although they were frequently inaccurate especially at this level of precision. In the 1600s Christiaan Huygens invented the pendulum clock, and this was the first device that could accurately and reliably measure minutes. Over time the pendulum clocks were improved and made more accurate, **it was only at this point that we were able to measure seconds**. Around this time we began to redefine time. Previously time was based on the Earth rotation, the passage of the sun across the sky, as reflected by the sun dials of old. With these new mechanical devices we were able to have a more accurate way of measuring time. For a while a second was defined as a fraction of a year, 1/31,556,925.9747 It wasnt until the invention of atomic clocks that we settled upon the now standard length of time elapsed by a second. Technically a second is defined as:  >  the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom We chose the caesium-133 atom because it has an extremely regular periods. And we chose that 9.1 billion number because it was extremely close to the accepted length of a second at the time.
Animals cannot drink dirty water safely. Humans also cannot drink dirty water safely. As many humans have access to alternatives (clean safe water) we do not tolerate the risk unless forced to do so. Animals have no choice but to tolerate the risk, and so they risk contaminants, toxins, parasites, and disease because the alternative is dying of thirst. Many animals are rife with parasites and other conditions we would not ordinarily tolerate.
American accents are most variable in terms of vowels, nasality, rhoticism (final R), intervocalic consonants (VCV), and final consonants. You will obviously find greater diversity in places like NYC. The dialect situation in America is very complicated. For example, one of the dialects of New Orleans is the 'yat' dialect, which can trace its ancestry directly to Brooklyn. In general, the **Inland North** is fairly 'standard.' It exhibits the Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The **East** and **Northeast** typically resists merging pin/pen, cot/caught, mary/merry/marry. As a result they have more vowel variation. Some NE dialects are non-rhotic and nasal. You will find larger differences between individual states here. The **Midlands** have some diversity, like in Ohio/Indiana... I'm not familiar with them. The **South** has a good deal of diversity, but most dialects are characterized by the Southern Cities Vowel Shift. Some also have drawls, where an extra schwa vowel (uh) is added after glides. Some dialects have double negatives. Again, there is sometimes non-rhoticism. The **North Central** typically merges the vowels I mentioned resisted by the NE accents. This accent is on the UP of Michigan, and northern WI/MN. They have strong rhotics and unreleased final consonants. "bag/flag/tag" are pronounced "beyg,fleyg,teyg." I believe there is a California Vowel Shift as well, but everything west of the Mississippi river is a mystery to me. Some dialects round their lips when pronouncing "sh" and "r" but I don't know who does/doesn't. **Caveat: Do not confuse vowel sounds with vowel letters. Our alphabet has 5 vowels, but the alphabet is irrelevant. Most Americans have 10-12 vowel phonemes, not counting diphthongs.**
It's a bit more personal and shows they put more thought into it. Say I have a friend who I know likes camping, but I don't know what exact thing they need. I'll get them a gift card for a store that sells camping supplies as a way to say "I don't know what you need, but I know what you like, so here's a compromise." It also forces the person to use it in a gift like way. If someone gives me money I'll feel like I should just put it into savings. More financially prudent, perhaps, but less exciting than spending it on something fun like you might get with a gift card.
It's all built from the concept of logic gates. Logic gates are simple statements like: if Input1 and Input2 are both true, then return true Or if either Input1 or Input2 is true, but not both, then return true Or If Input1 is false, then return true (or else false) By stringing those together in lots of complicated and clever ways, you can make the computer do any kind of mathematical logic you like.
I feel like the question was "Does it gulp a lot of water into it's stomach along with the food and does the water stay there or does it somehow get pushed out. And the reason this is an interesting question would be, does gulping large quantities of water mean that the shark is always ingesting way more water than food? And does that affect how it has to eat.
Humans have selectively bred a small number of species to help provide better for human needs at the expense of the animals natural survival. Sheep are one of those species. Prior to domestication sheep would have grown a much smaller amount of wool up to the point where it served their needs, like the hair on a bear or a wolf. It doesn't grow indefinitely. Then humans came along and found these relatively docile sheep sitting around and someone realised their wool was very useful to make things like clothing out of. Over many generations humans captured and bred these sheep to harvest their wool from. Humans also realised that by breeding the males and females with the most and best wool, the offspring would usually end up with even more wool than the parents. By repeating this process over time we ended up with the types of sheep we have today, who are completely reliant on humans to regularly shear them and remove the wool. This is domestication and selective breeding. Without us they would suffer many problems like overheating and being far too heavy.
You know what? The answers here stink. You could ask a Muslim sub (especially an ask/debate/101-style sub) but it might be seen as a bit inflammatory and you'll probably get rubbish answers of a different kind there too. My best advice is to ask /r/exmuslim - they know their Islam over there so well that they dislike it, but if you explain that you want to get some of the background behind it then you'll probably get a few people who know their hadiths and what have you to give a critical overview of that part of Muhammad's life. And they're a pretty funny bunch too.
Long story short, those posters are probably full of shit, considering that every home in America is fed by copper water pipes, and we're all still here.
Planes are not allowed to fly at the speed of sound over land (at least in the US). It causes an unpleasant sonic boom.
The inside of your nose, sinuses, and the nasal passage is covered by something called a 'mucous membrane'. Think of it like a wet carpet that has miniature water sprinklers, if you will. The function of such an arrangement is to make sure that the air reaching your lungs is not dry (which would in turn make your lungs dry, which is dangerous), amongst other things. Come winter, and a large number of viruses find it a very conducive environment to harbour themselves in your nasal mucous membrane. These in turn cause the glands secreting the mucus (the miniature water sprinklers) to work overtime. The purpose of this is to wash out the virus, broadly speaking. But as a result of this, mucus is produced in excess. When you're awake, this dribbles down the back of your throat due to gravity, not making its presence felt for the most part. When you're asleep, it becomes difficult for this to happen. So, it accumulates and dries up. This is why you get a clogged nasal passage. Another reason is that the miniature arteries carrying blood to the mucous membrane dilate themselves in response to the infection. This swells up the mucosa, giving you a sensation of a stuffed nose. Not exactly the most comprehensive explanation, but hope it helps.
A pharmacist is basically a specialist in medication, meaning they probably know more about medicines than some medical practitioners. They do so much more than dispense medicine, they also offer consults on use and dosage. They are also the last line of defence when it comes to drug interactions, especially when a patient is treated by numerous practitioners. And last but not least, they deserve a medal for being able to translate a practitioner's handwriting.
Ideally the supreme court should not be political at all. This is part of the reason why congress have to approve the supreme justices. The justices are appointed to make sure the will of the congress is followed and not their own will. If you were to make sure they were aligned politically you would open up another can of worms entirely. How do you make sure they are not extremists in each camp? How do you define the political sides as there are a lot of different opinions?
They Westernized very quickly. They have a very free economy, and I assume they have quite a bit of financial help from the USA and other western countries.
There are some good points talking about how it's due to infrastructure and the cost of maintaining their systems and how they have to pay for the spectrum and all that, and while ideally that would be the cause of data limits it's not. ISPs make an insane amount of profit, and a few years ago the government gave the largest ones money to improve their infrastructure (which they didn't do a very satisfactory job of). So if that isn't the cause then what is? Money. They want to make more money. If they set limits they can charge more for larger plans and charge overage fees. At least in the US it all comes down to making more money by screwing the customer.

Oh, let's count the ways that all those science fiction dreams of huge colonies on Mars aren't quite as feasible as the self-appointed futurists seem to think: --The radiation. Once you leave the protection of the Earth's magnetic field, you begin to die of radiation exposure. Just a "fast" trip to Mars is enough to significantly increase your risk of developing cancer. To live on Mars full-time, you'd need shielded habitats, covered in, say, a meter of concrete. But how do you intend to BUILD those habitats? Schlep cranes and bulldozers to Mars? And how do you propose to shield people when they go outside (or when they're building the habitat)? A shielded habitat also means no windows to look out of and no sunlight coming in. Hope you brought lotsa Grow Lights or a fuckton of vitamin D. Actually, even full Martian daylight doesn't contain enough sunlight to be healthy to humans. --The atmosphere. Mainly CO2, very low pressure. A colony will need air. Now, if you have plenty of water, and plenty of energy (solar power probably ain't gonna cut it here, that's a whole other can-o-worms), you can break water down into hydrogen and oxygen...but air is almost 80% nitrogen, and that's something Mars is noticeably short on. The ISS requires regular resupply of both oxygen and nitrogen, but that's low Earth orbit we're talking, not Mars (and oh yeah, by the way, for practical reasons, you can only launch a vehicle to Mars from Earth about every two years). --The gravity. The gravity of Mars is only about 38% that of Earth, so long-term colonists are going to find that they lose significant muscle and bone mass, even with exercise. We have no idea what the long-term effects of living in reduced gravity are. --The soil. You wanna grow food in dirt on Mars? Then it sucks to be you. The soil on Mars contains toxic levels of perchlorates. That's good news if you want to open a planet-wide chain of dry cleaning stores, not so much if you wanna live with the stuff. Be careful not to track any back into the habitat when you go outside (to, um, frolic in the deadly radiation), because that shit will start to build up in the atmospheric system. For a permanent colony, keeping it from building up in the habitat is essentially impossible. --The habitat. We simply don't know how to build a self-sustaining habitat on Earth, let alone someplace where the environment wants us dead. Not a clue. We don't even know *for sure* that it's possible on a small scale. Resupplying a small colony, let alone a large one, from Earth would be ruinously expensive, and perhaps not even technically feasible. And those are just the big ones. On top of all this, howzabout a reason it SHOULDN'T be done? I mean, aside from the obvious that it would cost hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, yet serve no useful purpose beyond the gee-whiz factor (we can do the science for about a *tenth* of the cost with robots). Contamination. We have had a few tantalizing clues about past or even current life on Mars, but the moment we plant the first muddy human bootprint there, it's game over for science. It's hard enough to sterilize a robot without reducing it to a pile of ash, but people are walking contamination machines. It is simply not possible to put people there and NOT hopelessly contaminate the environment. After that moment, any discovery made of life on Mars would come with built-in doubt about whether it was pristine, or the result of Earth contamination.

It's not controversial. There are some people who have no idea what they are talking about who have decided to pretend there is a controversy because they personally don't trust the actual...you know, experts. It's not controversial among the scientists and medical doctors at all.
Executive orders can only impact very narrow areas. They are, by definition, orders issued by the chief of the executive branch of the federal government, and as such can only impact federal agencies directly under the control of the executive branch, or in areas where authority has been expressly delegated to the executive branch by Congress. The president cannot legislate by fiat, and such power remains vested in Congress.
There's an entire field of philosophy called Social Contract dedicated to this thats as old as the field itself. It goes back thousands of years to Socrates, though it didnt really gain momentum until the 'modern' era (1500s-1700s). Like all of philosophy, it gives possible reasons but no "100% true" answers. A very, very brief (to the point of possibly being interpreted inaccurately) breakdown of some of the well known theories: * Socrates (Crito) - at some point, he chose to live in the society of Athens. By choosing to live in Athens instead of leaving, he implicitly agreed to follow the Law of Athens, since he always had the choice to leave. Socrates might say something like, "You chose to live in Canada, be a Canadian citizen, enter into contracts protected by Canadian law, and benefit from the Canadian law. Therefore, youre bound by that choice - even if you want to break it" * Hobbes - people are rational and people will act in their best interest. The 'original' way of living was the 'State of Nature' - kill or be killed, everything goes, and no morality or laws (since it was kill or be killed). But because people are rational and want to live outside such a brutal world, we came to the conclusion that giving up some of their freedoms to a sovereign will be better for their lives as a whole. He doesnt say this is exactly how it went down, but this is the reason why societies existed and why we derive our morals from the laws - we want to escape the State of Nature, so we internalize the laws of the society to become 'justice' and 'morals'. Hobbes might say something like, "Living in Canada is better than living in the state of nature. Even if that means being bound by laws you never agreed to or never learned, anything is better than the State of Nature". * Rawls (contemporary philosophy) - he goes through a thought experiment about 'Behind the Veil of Ignorance'. Basically, imagine yourself creating a society, but you dont know where you will eventually fall. You dont know if you will be male or female, rich or poor, what ethnicity you will be, etc. He that this "original person" will act in their own self interest - and because of that, there is no reason to give power to one side over another. You wouldnt give males more power than females, because you dont know if you would be male or female. Therefore, the "original person" would want a society thats fair for all sides, and this is from this position that morality and justice come from. He might say something like this, "If you were behind the Veil of Ignorance you wouldnt know if you were the one wanting to kill or you were the one being killed. Therefore, you would want a set of laws thats fair for both sides - in this case, you would rather give up your freedom to kill but protect yourself from being killed." TL;DR Philosophy tries to answer this question in different ways, but at some point either implicitly or explicitly, you decided to follow the law and live with others who follow the law. You never signed anything saying you wont kill people, but you agreed to it - you dont kill people and people dont kill you. If you dont like that agreement, you can leave the society and all its protections or break the law and get punished for it. Edit-formatting
Most people on here will be assholes over really minor things, you retarded piece of shit.
Most people think of racism as synonymous with discrimination or prejudice based on race. This will match up with the definition you find in most dictionaries. Some Sociology-related courses in college define racism and sexism as a political or societal system designed to hold back disadvantaged groups so that the prevailing group will stay in power. With this definition of racism/sexism, black people and women cannot be racist or sexist in America because they are not the ones with the position of power. Your professor would probably agree that black people and women can be *prejudiced*, but is probably using a different definition of racism and sexism than the colloquial definition.
Kim Jong-un is a huge fan of basketball. Dennis Rodman is there by invitation (and whatever crazy reasons he has personally). You wouldn't be killed there, though. They deny a lot of people entrance to their country arbitrarily, but if they did let you in, you'd just be watched at all times, most likely.
In the US, there isnt a general VAT, the taxes is different from state to state even city to city and as far down as different insitutions in those cities. It is easier for the retaliers to just put the price minus tax on the lables, as it would be the same nationwide, but the tax would then be applied at the cashier. Also there is an incentive to post prices without tax in the US because it "helps keep the prices low". compared to the retailers that do write the taxes on the price tag. If the retailers dont have to put the price + tax on the price tag, there isnt any reason for them to do it.
If light could experience time, it would seem instantaneous. Time would not pass at all once you reach 100% of c. However, it would arrive here to see that we aged 8 minutes and 8 minutes of time relative to us Earth-dwellers has passed. Basically, at the speed of light, time is meaningless, as it's all based off of the speed of light.
You give your bank your money. They put it in the vault and keep track of how much they have from you. They will from time to time lend your money to other people for mortgages or student loans. Because they can use your money for other things, they will pay you a small percentage on a monthly basis. This is called interest. At any time you can go to the bank and ask for some of your money (making a Withdrawal) or give them more money (making a Deposit.) People keep money in banks because it's secure, it's more convenient than carrying a lot of cash, and once you get a job, you can get your employer to put your salary directly in the bank account so that you don't have to cash a cheque every two weeks.

Let’s start from the beginning. What is a social security number? It’s a 9-digit number you are assigned from either birth in the U.S. or when you move to the U.S. to become a citizen or permanent resident. Social Security is a program in the U.S. designed to provide the elderly with an income once they reach a certain age (currently 66 but changes depending on a few different factors). The income the elderly receive depends upon what they made in income over the course of their lives. It’s more complicated than that, but you get the picture. When Americans file their federal income taxes every year, this is when they report to the government how much they made in income. In addition to that, over the course of the year, they have contributed to social security (through taxes). When they file the taxes, it is all filed by your social security number. Financial Institutions use social security numbers as a way of identifying individuals in the U.S. It is the only identification that every single (legal) American has. Not every American has a passport or driver’s license or state ID. When I say Financial Institutions, I also mean Creditors. Your social security number is linked to your credit and credit score. What’s a credit score? At the most basic level, this score tells Financial Institutions if you pay your bills and manage money well. Your credit score will be evaluated when you rent an apartment, apply for a mortgage, apply for a credit card, take out a car loan, etc. The biggest concern with this is identity theft. Someone could pretend to be you if they obtained your social security number. Now, a Financial Institution may ask for more than just your Social Security Number. But how hard is it now-a-days to get someone’s birthday, address, phone number, mother’s maiden name? Have access to Facebook? You now have all that information. If a Credit Card application comes in the mail, it’s easy to sign up for a credit card with someone else’s social security number. So, what happens if your identity IS stolen? If you like headaches, you’ll like getting your identity stolen. Ideally, once you got a notice that a credit card in your name is due for $10,000, you would call the company, tell them your identity was stolen, and they’d shut it down and fix your credit. In reality? Sure, they may cancel the card at your request, but they may ask for proof that your identity was stolen and you didn’t really spend $10,000. How do you prove you didn’t spend $10,000?

In cases where companies knew something was dangerous and sold it anyways, a lot of times this information comes out decades later as scientific and medical knowledge advances. Sometimes it's outside the statute of limitations, and investigations in general are much more difficult years down the line.

The holes in the lid are there so children are less likely to choke and suffocate if they swallow one. Edit: I'll just add this...  URL_0
